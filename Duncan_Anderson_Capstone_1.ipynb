Despite that, the staff offered to make us our coffee which we excitedly accepted. That was when the nightmare began.\\n\\nLittle did we realise that because the coffee machine was already cleaned, the staff had pre-prepared a few shots of coffee contained in the little paper cups circled in my pictures. They then poured that into another cup together with some steam milk and voila, that was our coffee. I have no issue with them closing early on a holiday but ending your coffee service as a cafe 30mins early is just bad business. And to use premade shots (god knows how long ago those shots were prepared) for customers\\' coffee is just unbelievable. I have attended artisanal coffee appreciation classes and the rule has always been \"grind on demand\" to ensure freshness in your coffee. Well clearly this wasn\\'t even close, as it\\'s not just the grinding but they went ahead with the brewing.\\n\\nI don\\'t even need to touch on the disappointment of the failed latte art as well.'],\n",

       "       [\"I really hesitated between a three and four star for this place. The first thing I must declare is that Le Trou is no contender for conventional Montreal bagels. For me, the real test is when you go to toast the bagel: the crispy/chewy ratio, the sweetness and certainly the spreadability (for other items on top, of course). Le Trou doesn't quite deliver on the first two criteria but it does support toppings very well. Thus far we've tried all of the flavours offered, with the exception of the cinnamon-raisin. The only flavour that really stands out to me is their signature bagel: the Griffintown (beer and cheese flavour). The problem with my affinity for this bagel is that it's the only one that isn't regularly priced: half a dozen for any of the other flavours hovers around the $5-6 range while the Griffintown will set you back $15 (!) for six. I think this is more than a bit much, frankly.\\n\\nWhat I really value about le Trou is that the majority of its products are affordable and it's in a location with few other comparable options.

I went with the strawberry crepe and my wife the choco-banane waffle. We were both dismayed by how bad the meal was considering the value we got for the price we paid.\\n\\nThe crepe was decent enough though the strawberries weren\\'t as good as they can be and the English cream, which lacked actual taste was way too liquidy. My wife\\'s waffle was decent enough as well but the chocolate felt \"off\", as if it were some poor imitation of actual chocolate. We were both seriously wondering when we left if the ingredients we got served were of the best quality as they can be.\\n\\nSecondly, both our meals came with no sides. Usually, you\\'d get a side of potatoes, fruits, toasts or whatnot but both our meals didn\\'t. It was a crepe filled with fruits and a waffle with some banana & chocolate. Coffee was included. \\n\\nPerhaps we were previously spoiled elsewhere in our experiences and it\\'s unfair to compare places to ALLO MON COCO but I can tell you for the $15 a plate we paid that this no where comes close to competition barely a few blocks away. A $15 plate with strawberry crepes elsewhere would come with fruits, potatoes, beans, toasts and whatnot.\\n\\nSo ultimately my experience was an average, overpriced breakfast with great service.

I thought it was really the law and let it go, but a quick google search showed this was not the case. If someone wants to make tip mandatory at their restaurant, it is fine just write it somewhere, but the owner lieing about it being mandatory in the province and asking in a surprising tone why I have never heard of this, is just theft.

However, ours was so heavily toasted, they were burnt. Yes, with actual charred, black patches on it. The lox was good but skimpy. The salad had one minimal drizzle of dressing on it, and it was composed solely of shredded lettuce, two cucumber slices and one tomato wedge. (At least the vegetables were fresh). And the cupcake was literally exactly like those that are sold in 12-packs at Safeway, except this one was stale.

The Lebanese restaurant has REAL bagels that make you tilt your head back and then choke on the surreal amount of seeds. So freaking good.\\n* Seeing my old friends I haven\\'t seen in a while. Well there are only a few of them here today since the holidays have begun. Normally I\\'m on holiday also.\\n\\nI hate restaurateurs who open up shop just for the money and don\\'t give a shit about food and these are easy to find in food-courts because food-courts are guaranteed no-fuss profit-centers. So many clients, the money just comes in no matter the crap you are serving. It\\'s like opening up a funeral home. Guaranteed client-base. And these owners don\\'t give a flying fuck about quality or about you, just your little dollar bills in your wallet.\\n\\nWhen lunch time comes around, a man\\'s gotta eat right? Well I head down to the food court. There was this Mexican place down there that made a tasty burrito. I loves the burrito.\\n\\nWell I get there and it\\'s like I took some fucked up kool-aid acid punch because there is some freaky shit going on here. First it\\'s now called Rotisserie Pollo. Pollo as in chicken. I sure as hell hope your rotisserie is rotissering chicken but I digress. And then the Rotisserie serves smoked meat sandwiches also and still serves a full arsenal of Mexican food. What the fuck is going on here? French-Italian name, serving smoked meat but with a mostly Mexican menu? Facepalm\\n\\nBut here\\'s the real kicker.

The thing is that I know that the Asian community would be in a fucking uproar if Mexicans decided to open up Sashimi restaurant. Either way you play it there\\'s a cultural disconnect here. Behind each food culture, there\\'s well... culture, even if it\\'s the fast food version. Because the invading culture lacks the intrinsic understanding of the inner workings and know-how that goes behind making something as mundane as a burrito how could they possibly understand the centuries of culture and meaning behind what you are eating. The Spanish didn\\'t show up in Mexico and then had instant Mexican culture. It evolved with its surroundings, with indigenous cultures and available foodstuff to become what it became today. The Asian restaurateur can\\'t just walk in and say I\\'m gonna make a burrito just like a Mexican. And here\\'s how they fucked up.\\n\\nFirst the rice. The served me up some short-grain rice steamed in the same steamer used to make that delicious sticky white rice form Asian cuisine. Ok first, the rice grown in America is long grain and has a completely different taste and texture. And you can\\'t just drop some \"Mexican flavour mix\" into the rice. For fuck\\'s sake, what the fuck was that? I have never tasted such synthetic tasting crap.\\n\\nThe fried tortillas tasted like fried Frito-Lays. It was likely the most horrible tortillas I have ever consumed and literally felt like puking after one bite.\\n\\nThe Burrito of Doom. WHY? WHY? WHY? How Could they travesty such a tasty delicious food. Gone was the beefy-tomatoey paste, gone was the tomato sauce, gone was the cheese. What was left was some greyish meat stuffing, raw onions (not even Spanish onions) and some lettuce and tomatoes.\\n\\n- Fast Food Made in China. -\\nIt\\'s enough that all our disposable lives have products made in China, but my food doesn\\'t have to be either. Working all over Montreal I\\'ve noticed something is that many restaurants are being taken over by Asians serving up the \"everything to everyone\" recipe for profitability. In another downtown court, a German restaurant has been taken over by the owners of the Chinese restaurant next to them. Now the German restaurant serves Lasagna and Poutine. Well sorry guys but if I go to a German restaurant its because I want GERMAN food, no? German sausage, sauerkraut, mash and beer. Not Italian food.

Not special per se but not offensive either. I move on to the star, that gorgeous eggs Benedict. Yolk is PERFECT. Just a perfectly, perfectly poached egg, so I tear off a bit of my extra English muffin, and hmmm- it\\'s not buttered, but is toasted, and wow it\\'s DENSE, nothing like the light, airy, crispy, BUTTERED thing one expects with an English muffin. Then I take this dense, unbuttered...thing and dip it into my egg yolk and hollandaise slurry, and hmmm again: the hollandaise has no, zero, lemon. Lemon is a NECESSARY aspect of a hollandaise, and my big issue with most resto versions of this French bit of heaven is that they never seem to put enough lemon juice into it. Well, this one had NONE.

None. I signal the waiter and try to say that \"there is no asparagus here\" and with the assistance of google translate, get my point across, so she ascertains that the asparagus was \"of poor quality\" and so the chef elected to cut it into small pieces. Okay, it the asparagus was bad, why was I not informed of this when I ordered it, and second-- there was no asparagus in this dish. Asparagus was the most expensive and most precious thing on the plate and would \\xa0have married beautifully with a COMPETENT hollandaise, but there was none.

We shared a smoothie.\\n\\nThe Mac and cheese was very light on taste but had a cheesy flavourful nonetheless. The waffle, however, was extremely chewy and unpleasant to eat.

Not special per se but not offensive either. I move on to the star, that gorgeous eggs Benedict. Yolk is PERFECT. Just a perfectly, perfectly poached egg, so I tear off a bit of my extra English muffin, and hmmm- it\\'s not buttered, but is toasted, and wow it\\'s DENSE, nothing like the light, airy, crispy, BUTTERED thing one expects with an English muffin. Then I take this dense, unbuttered...thing and dip it into my egg yolk and hollandaise slurry, and hmmm again: the hollandaise has no, zero, lemon. Lemon is a NECESSARY aspect of a hollandaise, and my big issue with most resto versions of this French bit of heaven is that they never seem to put enough lemon juice into it. Well, this one had NONE. But the potatoes were so-so and I was hungry so I proceeded to eat the rest of my plate, which had evolved in only a few moments from \"oh-my-God this looks delicious\" to \"this is worse than \\'eggs Benedict\\' you get from iHOP.\" \\xa0\\n\\nBut the worst part was that this Benedict had NO ASPARAGUS. None. I signal the waiter and try to say that \"there is no asparagus here\" and with the assistance of google translate, get my point across, so she ascertains that the asparagus was \"of poor quality\" and so the chef elected to cut it into small pieces. Okay, it the asparagus was bad, why was I not informed of this when I ordered it, and second-- there was no asparagus in this dish. Asparagus was the most expensive and most precious thing on the plate and would \\xa0have married beautifully with a COMPETENT hollandaise, but there was none. I finished up and went to pay, and here\\'s another galling aspect: That English muffin was $3 extra and I was not comped one cent for receiving a dish that lacked the star ingredient. Not a penny.

The music, however, didn't match at all, since it was really loud, Top 40/pop from the 90s, which I usually really enjoy, but because of the large seats, I was seated a lot further away from my husband and it was hard enough to hear him without having to lean forward every second.\\n\\nMy husband was really craving a poutine, so he ordered the only one that was on the menu.

I had a bite and it was absolutely not the Montreal poutine we're used to, and though I always like to try remixed versions of different foods, this was a miss for the both of us. The pickled onions were the kind that you find in shawarmas and seemed odd instead of white/yellow onions, the dijon mustard was overwhelming, and the super sweet toffee thing was soooo strange to me, since the rest was savoury and it was so out of place in terms of flavor. The portion was huge, but for nearly $20, it should've been!\\n\\nI got the beef tataki since they ran out of the deer, which was super disappointing. I also found it expensive for the portion size that I got (3 pieces), but that's usually the case for tataki. The beef was more of a medium rare than just a sear, but had some nice Asian flavors, with sesame and maybe some ginger/soy. The salad was really good, with arugula, cherry tomatoes, fresh dill, large Parmesan shavings, and some olive oil.\\n\\nOur server was really great, friendly and attentive (one of the main reasons for the third star), but the food was just okay, and for the price point, way too expensive for the quality/quantity, depending on what you're eating.

The music, however, didn't match at all, since it was really loud, Top 40/pop from the 90s, which I usually really enjoy, but because of the large seats, I was seated a lot further away from my husband and it was hard enough to hear him without having to lean forward every second.\\n\\nMy husband was really craving a poutine, so he ordered the only one that was on the menu. It had cheese curds, smoked meat, pickled onions, beer gravy, mustard, and this hard caramel toffee thing. Honestly, I found it really weird. I had a bite and it was absolutely not the Montreal poutine we're used to, and though I always like to try remixed versions of different foods, this was a miss for the both of us. The pickled onions were the kind that you find in shawarmas and seemed odd instead of white/yellow onions, the dijon mustard was overwhelming, and the super sweet toffee thing was soooo strange to me, since the rest was savoury and it was so out of place in terms of flavor. The portion was huge, but for nearly $20, it should've been!\\n\\nI got the beef tataki since they ran out of the deer, which was super disappointing. I also found it expensive for the portion size that I got (3 pieces), but that's usually the case for tataki. The beef was more of a medium rare than just a sear, but had some nice Asian flavors, with sesame and maybe some ginger/soy. The salad was really good, with arugula, cherry tomatoes, fresh dill, large Parmesan shavings, and some olive oil.\\n\\nOur server was really great, friendly and attentive (one of the main reasons for the third star), but the food was just okay, and for the price point, way too expensive for the quality/quantity, depending on what you're eating.

They do taste slightly different than NY bagels though. \\xa0Nevertheless, bagels are more than just some bread with a hole in the center, they need to be dense and chewy. \\xa0This is accomplished through the following:\\n\\n1. \\xa0High-gluten flour (for bagel body and taste)\\n\\n2. \\xa0Boiled! (For more bagel body and chewiness)\\n\\n3. \\xa0Hand-rolled (for bagel body)\\n\\n4. \\xa0Non-chlorinated water (taste)\\n\\nSupposedly Montreal-style bagels are boiled in honey water to impart a sweetness to the dough. \\xa0Well, that was the first thing I noticed when I bit into the first bite of my poppy bagel, just how sweet it was! \\xa0The sweetness was overpowering, completely obscuring the savoriness of the poppy seeds. \\xa0As I continue to chew, \\xa0the body of the bagel just isn\\'t there. \\xa0It\\'s not dense and only slightly chewy. \\xa0I look at the underside of the bagel. \\xa0Aha! \\xa0Just as I suspected, lines on the bottom from laying on a rack from steaming. These tell-tale signs likely resulted from speeding up the boiling process by instead steaming them. \\xa0It creates the shine on the outside of a bagel but deprives the dough of bagel habeus-corpus i.e. having the \"body\" a bagel should have. \\xa0Then I noticed it just tasted like a Philly pretzel and not worth my calories. \\xa0\\n\\nI\\'ll give St. Viateur\\'s its due though, they put on a lovely show as they\\'re rolling the dough. \\xa0So there\\'s that.\\n\\nNote: They also won\\'t put cream cheese or butter on the bagel for you so you\\'re on your own.'],\n",

      "I really hesitated between a three and four star for this place. The first thing I must declare is that Le Trou is no contender for conventional Montreal bagel. For me, the real test is when you go to toast the bagel: the crispy/chewy ratio, the sweetness and certainly the spreadability (for other items on top, of course). Le Trou doesn't quite deliver on the first two criteria but it does support toppingss very well. Thus far we've tried all of the flavours offered, with the exception of the cinnamon-raisin. The only flavour that really stands out to me is their signature bagel: the Griffintown (beer and cheese flavour). The problem with my affinity for this bagel is that it's the only one that isn't regularly priced: half a dozen for any of the other flavours hovers around the $5-6 range while the Griffintown will set you back $15 (!) for six. I think this is more than a bit much, frankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I really value about le Trou is that the majority of its products are affordable and it's in a location with few other comparable options. I find I'm generally hard-pressed to find bread-like items in the Sud-Ouest, as such I'm happy to have access to a bagel shop (with reasonable hours!). Oh, and the space itself is very cute and modern, although definitely not your grandma's bagel shop.\n",
