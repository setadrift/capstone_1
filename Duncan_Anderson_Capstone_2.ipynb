I paid and was on my way. Upon opening the bagel outside, I realized why the bagel was priced as it was. The bagel behind the counter was not the bagel I had gotten. Mine was absolutely tiny and I kid you not, there was no more than a teaspoon of the cream cheese on it. Only about half my bites had any cream cheese at all. A laughably small amount of cream cheese. It was hard to eat, and I was very annoyed. Horrible, horrible experience, and I had to go somehwere else to fill up. I also almost bought a small naked juice until I realized it was over $6. I will never go back there again. I wish I had taken a picture of the joke of a bagel. I downloaded yelp just to warn others of this place.\n",

I\\'ve walked by it a million times, but have never tried it out. I was walking to work and pushing my son in his stroller. Despite the fact that my son was quiet and well-behaved, I wish I had taken pictures of the death stares that I got from the cashier and baristas. They all looked at me like I walked in with bloody knives and a dead animal. Seriously, this place is located on the UES, which is one of the most family-friendly neighborhoods in Manhattan. Yet this place is perhaps the most family UN-friendly place I\\'ve ever been to in NYC. Stay far far away from this place. There are so many other options in the area that serve better-quality coffee anyway. I\\'ll be telling all of my friends and neighbors to never patronize this place.\",1,2019-11-02,40.7896239,-73.9598939\\nII Caffe Latte 2,Lenis M.,\"Rudest and unprofessional workers ever \\nI would never come to this place again \\xa0\\n\\nPlace was empty, literally only me and my friend there and these two workers would not stop asking us to order and rush us through out.

So . . . . no idea why I haven\\'t written a review for the other but I know I\\'ve been here. Maybe years ago? Anyway, the bagels are just as good as I\\'ve remembered. Absolutely one of my favorite bagels in the entire New York city region. The bagels are massive and have the perfect chew. The cream cheese comes in a pile on your perfect sandwich of dough. The flavors are always unique and keep you coming back. I went for pumpkin cream cheese while I was out in Queens cat sitting this past weekend, knowing my opportunity for returning will probably be ages since I live in Brooklyn and rarely travel boroughs during covid now. I initially ordered the cream cheese on an egg bagel (usually my go to choice among bagels) and one of the workers informed me they actually also have a pumpkin bagel! Well slap me silly. I changed my order to pumpkin/pumpkin quite enthusiastically. It\\'s definitely an interesting bagel. It\\'s covered in toasted pumpkin seeds and the flavor is subtle but great and the texture is just perfect. It\\'s kind of still eggy like an egg bagel so I like that factor. Really you can\\'t go wrong with any of their bagels or sandwich options. The ordering process was also simple. Only maybe 2 or 3 people waiting distanced inside the store for their orders. Which is interesting because the Broadway spot has always had a line any time I used to go there.

As simple as sandwiches can be, not everyone does them right, and yes, even sandwiches can be made with love. Compton\\'s got their sandwich game down. Let me explain...\\n\\nThere are tons of bodegas around NYC who have sandwich menus, where you can (and girl, I have) order mediocre sandwiches. It gets the job done in terms of satisfying your hunger, but places like Compton\\'s come into play, when you want a sandwich that is both filling, AND f*cking delicious. Not to mention, they invest in atmosphere, and give you all the feels of Compton itself, with the hip hop music and dope decor. \\n\\nI ordered three of their sandwiches and they ALL get five stars from me......periodT! I started with The Rob hero, which is simply a turkey sandwich with avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato, red onion and lime aioli. I don\\'t know where they got this turkey from, but something about it just hit different! It was tender and delicious. As simple as a turkey sandwich can be, The Rob shows that it can be elevated and taken to another level. I ordered extra lime aioli, and girl, I\\'m glad I did. Next up, I ordered the sticky tender hero, which tasted like I was eating buffalo wings. It had the perfect spice, and that bleu cheese dressing that slapped! The chicken tenders were just that....tender, well-breaded, well-seasoned. Damn. The last sandwich I got was the burrata cheesesteak, which excited me, solely for the reason of it being made with burrata. It was truly a Philly cheesesteak....with burrata lol. I do wish that I got \\nsome truffle flavor on there from the truffle balsamic glaze, but I mean, it was delicious regardless. \\n\\nYou can tell that someone sat down, and carefully crafted each recipe for these sandwiches. You taste the effort in each one, and there isn\\'t an ingredient on any of them that didn\\'t belong. You want a bomb ass sandwich?

So if you like dry sandwiches and if you don\\'t specify exactly what you want in it (like lettuce), then expect to only get exactly what you ask for. Just the veggie patty on a bun. Literally.

My memory of a rather tall quiet man, perhaps the original William Greenberg, came as close to that genteel image as possible in Manhattan. \\n\\nIn his small shop were cookies and cakes. I particularly recall a chocolate frosted cake that tasted really homemade. William Greenberg had a reputation of excellence in those under-hyped days. Never a fan of black and white cookies. So I don\\'t know if they were a specialty then, as they seem to be now. My memory is five star but contemporary reviews are anything but.\\n\\nRemnants of that charming shop seem still existent. At the time there may have been a second shop further east. Good to have known the original. Photos of the present day bakery hint that baking is done off the premises.

I got a whole wheat everything bagel with plain cream cheese, toasted. I thought the bread was too thick, a thicker dough than I\\'ve ever had before and as any other bagel place would give you, there was an excessive amount of cream cheese. It tasted more like a whole wheat bagel than an everything bagel which also was a turn off for me.

It has been opened for less than a week. The place has a very nice decor to it and lots of open space/seating and natural light. I really had high hopes for this place. I was originally going to give them 4* but the way they handled our service, our friends service, and just eavesdropping on the service of other patrons, it forced me to give this place 3*.\\n\\nI had no issues with their food. I thought their bagels were good. I tried their cinnamon raisin bagel and garlic bagel. I had them toasted and both bagels still tasted great. I had cinnamon raisin walnut cream cheese in the cinnamon raisin bagel and I did not think it was overly sweet. For the garlic bagel, I had the lox cream cheese on it. The lox cream cheese wasn\\'t bad but in my opinion, the lox flavor wasn\\'t strong enough. I think this particular spread is better at other locations.\\n\\nI also ordered iced coffee with vanilla and the drink just came out to be too sweet. Please dial it back.\\n\\nIn terms of service, there was no problems placing the order. The issue was the communication. One person took our orders and a different person prepared our bagels. Unfortunately, the person making our bagel would sometimes forget what we had ordered so would ask us again what we ordered. This wasn\\'t so bad but it was confounded by the fact that it happened to a lot of customers. In addition, a lot of times, the wrong bagel was made and even after telling them it was made in correctly, the supposedly \"\"fixed\"\" bagel was sometimes incorrectly made again. I was very patient with them but I knew a lot of other patrons were not. The good thing is that they were more than willing to rectify the mistake. \\n\\nMy suggestion to them is either change the system in how things are ordered and made OR use a check list menu type system where the patrons tick of boxes as to what they want so that menu can act as the order ticket and everyone will know what is ordered. This will greatly minimize the mistakes being made. If it is the case that the workers have extremely short term memory, another suggestion would be to hire workers with better memories.\\n\\nAnother suggestion would be to move the hanging menus forward/closer to the ordering counter so everyone can see. The font on the menu isn\\'t big enough to be so far back. I don\\'t need a test of my eyesight while trying to order breakfast.\\n\\nOne last suggestion is to put the store hours somewhere. I have not been successful in finding the store hours.\\n\\nI know this is their 1st week of opening and I completely understand these issues/woes of a new opening. I plan on coming back in 1 month because I do believe that this store can do well. I hope in the interim, some of these issues will have been resolved. \\n\\nThis place is such a great location for a bagel shop and it\\'s a welcomed alternative to dunkin donuts around the corner and starbucks across the street. Because this place is close to me, I would come here more often, but they have to get their act together.\",3,2015-06-27,38.7521235,-121.2880059\\nSmashiess,Maximilian L.,\"I love Smashies! \\xa0I\\'ve been talking about doing the smashies challenge forever. \\xa0They have other eating challenges not on the wall too, like eating four pieces of wonderbread in under 1 minutes (I think it was 1 minute)\\n\\nGo to smashies.\",5,2016-04-14,40.7896239,-73.9598939\\nMr Bagelsworth,Fernando R.,Never ordering again.

It felt unjustifiable to give 3 stars and 4 seems generous - 3.5 would be perfect. \\n\\nI usually get the whole wheat everything bagel with egg and bacon (only after long nights of imbibing...), and it often hits the spot. The bagels are fluffy and missing the hole in the center - the epitome of a good NYC bagel. However, sometimes they\\'re too chewy and lack the crunch on the outside. I will also say that their everything bagels lack enough seasoning! I always add Trader Joe\\'s everything but the bagel. Would love if they added carroway seeds to their everything bagels. Prices seem pretty standard for NY bagels. I definitely choose this place over H&H but Tal over Pick-a-bagel.

Whether it\\'s wheat, oni onion, sesame, raisin, or an everything bagel, I love it toasted with some lox and cream cheese. The latter comes in such a variety that just choosing one can be a task. The flavors are so vast that it can be overwhelming, even for folks who have been here multiple times. When in doubt, sample them all. Every concoction is worth trying. Don\\'t sleep on the flavor of the month, oftentimes it\\'s a flavor not often used.\\n\\nOf course they have more than bagels. They also serve breakfast wraps and sandwiches that are hearty and loaded. The hungry man is my favorite since they stuff the wrap with chunks of avocado, sausage, eggs, cheese, and hashbrown patties. \\xa0Their coffee is also worthy and goes well with any of their bagels.\\n\\nLastly the service is always on point. I\\'ve always been impressed at how efficiently and quickly they serve folks and somehow manage to smile all throughout.

Bialy\\'s have become a bit of an endangered species. In fact a woman asked the cashier just this morning, \"\"What is a bialy?\"\" The cashier says, \"\"It\\'s sort of like a bagel with poppy seeds and onion. It\\'s good.\"\" Sort of, exactly wrong but I appreciate the effort. \\n\\nBack to the breads. The bialy, pepita square, nan el barbari are my faves. \\n\\nThe bialy is a crusty, chewy, breakfast roll with a touch of sweetness from the caramelized onion. If you need instructions on how to toast it without losing all the filling I can show you. \\n\\nThe pepita square is a dense whole grain, healthy tasting bread with pumpkin seeds that is delicious toasted and slathered in butter. \\n\\nThe nan el barbari is a flat bread topped with nigella and sesame seeds. I like to slice it, toast it and then serve it pan con tomate style. It is divine. \\n\\nI have had better challah, stollen and babka (see cohen\\'s bakery in ellenville). \\xa0Also, no whole wheat challah, please?\\n\\nThe bread is pricey but worth it. The rolls typically are a better value and after 2p you pay what you will. \\n\\nTwo of the women who work there are friendly and competent - the rest are not. I do not mind incompetence as long as someone is friendly. But attitude and incompetence. No way. So, now I buy my bread and DIY it at home. \\n\\nOther important details - the bread stock varies depending on what the online / delivery demands are for the day. Translation, the bread available to storefront customers are the dregs. So, you cannot count on a nan el barbari unless someone online made an order. They are still amazing but again the storefront is an after thought. \\n\\nSometimes, the staff from the incubator will come down and make themselves a snack. Or work the bakery and make food for others. Now, I\\'m all about flavor OK, but \"\"Where have those hands been?\"\"\\n\\nMostly I say go. It is a really special place. The bread is beyond worth it. \\n\\nMy hope is that HBK would be more transparent that the storefront is second class to the incubator. Also, it\\'s spanish harlem at la marqueta.

I don\\'t know if they have switched management or just got their act together, but I have found myself going here at least once a week. It\\'s pretty much the only bagel and coffee place in the immediate area, so it\\'s a go-to for the time being. \\n\\nI still don\\'t order bagels with cream cheese here, but my boyfriend does and says that they have gotten better about not slathering it with excessive cream cheese when you ask them not to. My favorite thing to get is a pumpernickel bagel with lox. The bagels are always fresh, and the lox is just as fresh and high-quality as similar places in Midtown and the UES. The upside is that while places in those neighborhood charge upwards of $13.00 for a lox bagel, Bagel Tree prices theirs at a very reasonable $7.00.\\n\\nThe only thing I\\'ll dock points for is that their coffee is very overpriced. A medium iced latte is about $5.00, and the coffee sometimes tastes stale. They should either drop those prices or improve the product. \\n\\n---------------\\nRight around the corner and I still won\\'t go back. When I say \"\"light cream cheese\"\" I don\\'t mean \"\"glob it on until it reaches critical mass\"\". So much spread on my bagel that it squirted all over my handbag and my clothes. Disgusting!

After waiting a couple of minutes, I called the delivery guy\\'s phone a couple of times, but my calls went unanswered. I also responded to the text message with my apartment building\\'s address that he sent me. Then, I called the restaurant, and the person who answered the phone said that the delivery guy was \"\"lost\"\". After being placed on hold for about 3 minutes, I called the restaurant back, and the guy said that the building does not exist. Um, I\\'ve been living in this is the place for over three years so I\\'m pretty sure that it exists. I proceeded to give the restaurant guy specific directions (e.g. the building is in between this park and this avenue) to pass along to the delivery person. Keep in mind this information is already in my Grubhub address profile, so the restaurant had this information. Clearly, there is some sort of mental delay. \\n\\nThen the guy comes up with a wonderful idea for me to walk and meet the delivery guy who was the equivalent of 3-4 blocks from my apartment. Ummmm. If I wanted to pick up my food then I would have ordered takeout from another place. Also, where does a restaurant establishment get off charging a customer a delivery fee but not have the delivery person drop of the food at the intended address? This fee is in addition to the tip that I provided with my order. \\n\\nSo the guy at the restaurant in a very nasty manner said that he had to cancel the order because my apartment does not exist. A few moments later, I get a text from Grubhub saying that my apartment is out of the restaurant\\'s delivery area. \\n\\nPretty much everyone in this day in age has smartphones with GPS capabilities.

The staff was really helpful in answering my questions. My friend and I both got the traditional chai, which was really good. It\\'s a steep price for chai with some cups costing about $10.

The staff is always friendly and generous with samples. \\n\\nCame here today with my sis who\\'s visiting from Los Angeles and we ordered way too much and had not regrets. \\n\\nMust haves:\\n\\n1. Lobster salad - Usually I order this on a bialy, but today I got a half pound to go with some bagel slices. It\\'s THE BEST lobster salad. Just fresh lobster and a little bit of mayo. This is my go to when I want to pack my own food for long flights. The mayonnaise keeps the salad fresh while traveling in my backpack to JFK. (Do you really want to eat previously frozen and now defrosted and microwaved bland white chicken with mystery sauce inflight?)\\n\\n2. Lobster clam chowder - I prefer brothy vs creamy flour fluffed chowders. This one has an amazingly rich flavor, chunks of meat, and usually feeds two people. You can order it cold or hot depending on whether or not you\\'re consuming it right away. \\n\\n3. Smoked white fish and salmon salad - Creamy, fishy, and salty. Perfect over our bed of plain baby spinach tonight. \\n\\n4. Shrimp salad - So good on its own or with bread. \\n\\n5.

Used to be my favorite local bagel shop, but little by little their disorganization grew and now the customer service has gone down hill. Staff is very rude. Not only do they provide unnecessary attitude with their service, at times they mutter under their breath and talk about you or other patrons in the line. (How do I know? They will look/nod/point at the person they are speaking about to their colleagues and either laugh, squint, or give a response in a disapproving way). I now understand why many have provided 1-2 star reviews for this place.

The texture is different than NY-style, yes, but it\\'s ok to switch it up sometimes. It\\'s a soft, spongey, more breadlike texture on the inside and the same bagel hardness on the outside. \\n\\nThe vegetarian buffalo bagel is tasty and almost vegan (the bagels are boiled in honey water). But I wouldn\\'t call it buffalo.... the flavor of the \"\"buffalo cauliflower\"\" is a more of a spicy-sweet flavor, not full-on sweet chili, but slightly sweet and just not resembling buffalo sauce at all. And the pickles on the sandwich are slightly sweet too, like bread & butter style pickles - I hate this type of pickle but I also think it does the sandwich a disservice by adding additional sweetness. \\n\\nThe herb tofu is nice.

I\\'ve walked by hundreds of times and noticed one day a new sign outside advertising $1 samosas (I believe now $1.25) so I stopped in on a whim. \\n\\nThe owner was so unbelievably friendly and welcoming and very grateful for the business. They opened at the beginning of the year and had to close for a few months right off the bat due to COVID.\\n\\nI\\'ve been several times since and Sonni keeps adding new Indian dishes to the menu. \\n\\nChicken curry ($7.99) is a milder yellow curry and not oily at all. I\\'ve had it twice and once it was chicken with bones (my preference) and the other time it was chicken breast cubes. \\n\\nPaneer chili ($7.50) is Sonni\\'s take on a fusion, with paneer cubes, onions, red and green bell peppers in a medium spicy sauce. \\n\\nChanna masala ($7.50) is good. Chickpeas simmered with tomatoes and spices. I generally find channa masala good wherever I get it (it\\'s hard to mess up).\\n\\nButter chicken was a bit more oily (obvious, given it\\'s made with butter) and more spicy and salty than the other chicken curry.\\n\\nEgg vindaloo ($7.50) comes with two hard boiled eggs and potatoes in a spicy curry. Tried it last night and it\\'s one of my favorites now.\\n\\nThe samosa chaat ($4) is a clear winner for me. It\\'s a broken up samosa with a chickpea or pea curry on top, with tamarind and cilantro chutney, raita (yogurt), spices, onion, green peppers, and spices and garam (chickpea flour/flakes). It takes a bit more time to make but it\\'s so delicious. \\n\\nSavor is now my go-to for friendly service and delicious food in the neighborhood. Will be back a bunch more! If anything, go for the $1.25 samosa and let Sonni put a smile on your face. They are still adding Indian specials to their menu so be prepared for some inconsistency as they figure it out, but that won\\'t take away from the experience.\",5,2020-10-04,40.7896239,-73.9598939\\nThe Bagel Shop,Morgan C.,\"This place has the best bagels on the UES.

The restaurant was busy but wasn\\'t packed at the time. They offer a variety of breakfast from pastries to dishes! We ordered power breakfast and a French toast to share. The power breakfast was such a great deal. It comes with 3 eggs, bacon or sausage, salad, choice of bread, potatoes (amazingly good), choice of juice, and coffee or tea. The breakfast combo was so good. The portion was perfect for us; not too small and definitely will fill you up. The black coffee I got was kind of light in flavour though. It was good but not my type. \\n\\nTheir French toast was so yum! They have 2 savoury flavours and 3 sweet flavours. I wanted to try the caramel banana walnut but they didn\\'t have it. We tried the mascarpone mixed berry instead and it turned out great! The toast itself has no flavour. It was good together with both spreads on! \\n\\nTheir host was nice as well. I took time taking food pictures and he asked if I\\'m posting and as a reward he gave us cookies haha.\\n\\nThere was a line by the time we left (around 10:10pm).

I always get a plain bagel w/egg, ham, and mozzarella. But today the server understood my order as an egg bagel with cold cheese and cold ham. . .For starters why would that be an actual order? But secondly, why would the server not politely ask if I wanted anything else in my bagel, such as egg? \\n\\nAnyways that\\'s a completely understandable mistake. After making it back home and realizing, I made it back to the store to get my order remade. This is when the dine-in server on the side of the cashier started to blame me for the mistake. Truly the hostile response was unexpected. He went on to demand I buy another egg sandwich only for the egg. This is when the actual server asked him if they could just add the eggs to the bagels as is. If you know about the food industry, this notion is against regulations but also highly discouraged during COVID. Food that has been prepped for to-go and has been served to a client should never make its way back to the kitchen counter since it poses a risk of contamination to the rest of the food being served. \\n\\nThe server is not necessarily at fault since she seemed new and was docile when dealing with this situation. The one to blame is the guy that was to her left. I\\'m unsure what title he holds but is the server standing in front of the bagel rack and muffins. He needs to work on his customer service skills.\",2,2021-04-23,40.7498243,-73.7976337\\nBroad Nosh Bagels,Galit S.,\"I had to think a lot before publishing my awful experience there (due to the pandemic effect on the business in the neighborhood).\\nI bought a too good to go voucher. \\nWhen I came to pick up the order, the employees and the owner were very rude to us and they didn\\'t bother to help us.

R.,\"In the midst of the pandemic, I\\'ve taken to ordering smoked salmon delivery for myself as an occasional treat. \\xa0The good news is that the smoked salmon from Sable\\'s, delivered by Goldbelly, is incredibly good. \\xa0The Scottish, Norwegian and Gaspé are delicious beyond words, sliced thinly and with care, well packed in several layers of protection plus ice packs for the two-day delivery journey. \\xa0In the whole world, there is nothing tastier. \\xa0\\n\\nThe bad news is that to meet the delivery minimum I continually have to order an item besides the pound of salmon I can store and eat at a time without risking freshness. \\xa0Here the news isn\\'t as good. \\xa0I have ordered their scallion cream cheese a few times, and the quality has varied enormously. \\xa0The latest version was watery and possibly on the verge of not being fresh. \\xa0Earlier versions tasted ok, but ranged from smooth to lumpy with curds. \\xa0Don\\'t know what to make of that. \\xa0\\n\\nThen I have tried their \"\"Plain Herring Filets\"\", which is advertised as in the photo attached to this review with the slogan \"\"Once you try Sable\\'s tender pickled herring fillets you\\'ll never settle for the canned stuff again!\"\" \\xa0As you can see, their picture shows shiny, large herring fillets rolled up. \\xa0What is actually delivered are tiny strips of herring in murky sweet pickle juice: \\xa0reasonably tasty, but not obviously different from what you can buy in jars at Whole Foods (don\\'t know about cans) for much less money: $5.99 at Whole Foods vs. Sable\\'s $27.95, for approximately the same quantity. \\xa0\\n\\nI have also tried ordering H&H bagels from them, which came roughly packaged in a large jumble, and not as fresh as similar orders from other NYC shops.\\n\\nSo what to do? \\xa0I am still hunting for an add-on to my smoked salmon purchases that is worth the money and that I want to eat. \\xa0Because indeed the salmon is really really good. \\xa0If only they lowered their $75 delivery \\xa0minimum, or offered a greater varety of addtional items at a reasonable cost, the problem could be solved.\",4,2021-01-15,42.3602534,-71.0582912\\nBroadway Restaurant,Joan M.,\"Thank God we did not lose this place!

A group of about 8 women (some with very little English skills) arrived one by one, got their work authorizations checked, and waited for the group interview, orientation, and tour to begin. \\xa0I got to witness a brief peek into how this all works! \\xa0I have no idea how often they do initial interviewing.\\n\\nTo share at home, I picked up: \\n-- Nan-e Quadi ($3ea x2, \"\"A rich, creamy Persian sweetbread made with milk and honey and topped with sesame seeds. Ideal for breakfasts or afternoon tea.\"\"), \\n-- M\\'smen ($2.50ea x2, \"\"A buttery, flaky Moroccan flatbread that melts in your mouth -- made with wheat flour, semolina, and butter. Traditionally eaten for breakfast with honey, it\\'s also great with lamb and onions.\"\")\\n-- Nan-e Barbari ($4ea x4 halves, \"\"A savory Persian flatbread with a chewy crust, topped with black and white sesame seeds.\"\")\\n-- Bialy ($2ea x2, \"\"Classic New York breakfast roll filled with caramelized onions and poppy seeds and baked directly on the hearth.\"\")\\n-- Macadamia Nut Cookies ($2.75 for a 2-pack) for my little cookie monster waiting on the UWS!\\n\\nMy Persian husband was not super enthused about the Quadi and Barbari-- he felt the Barbari was a little too thick and dense and I tend to agree. \\xa0In my experience from authentic Iranian bakeries in the US, Canada, and Iran it is true that Barbari tends to be a little more delicate than that of HBK\\'s. \\xa0But we both went bananas over the M\\'smen which we shared for breakfast the next morning drizzled with honey-- reminded us of all those amazing and elaborate Moroccan breakfasts we had during a trip there ten years ago! \\xa0The bialy\\'s tasted good to me, but I\\'m not sure I\\'ve ever had one before so unsure what they are \"\"supposed\"\" to taste like. \\xa0And my little one gobbled up those mac nut cookies and didn\\'t even complain about the lack of chocolate (usually a must for her!)\\n\\nMy total came to $39.25 for lunch and all the take-home goodies, which I thought was a pretty nice deal for this city. \\xa0All in all, a place I will support again the next time I am in the city!!\",5,2016-05-25,47.6038321,-122.3300624\\nBAMBU,Dom G.,\"Been waiting for Bambu near me to open and it\\'s finally here! \\n\\nGot myself Bambu Favorite and a pandan waffle.

The inside is super open with lots of windows and a combination of regular tables and chairs along with a couple of high-tops.

I decided to get chicken tacos; these were pretty good - two generously sized tacos with some sauce to go on top. They didn\\'t have the biggest flavor but weren\\'t awful either - though they were a bit on the greasy side. The chips and guac were pretty good - again not amazing (chips from a bag) but just fine. I enjoyed the drinks - the bellini and mimosa were as good as any other brunch place I\\'d been to and their white sangria was quite tasty. \\n\\nService was good, all the staff we interacted with were friendly - overall not the best place I\\'ve been to for brunch but it wasn\\'t awful. You kind of have to take it as it is; they\\'re inside a museum so I don\\'t know if going all out and being super on-trend is what they\\'re trying to convey.

We weren\\'t necessarily looking to eat here but the menu looked good so we decided to try it out.\\n\\nSide Park is located inside El Museo del Barrio. The inside is super open with lots of windows and a combination of regular tables and chairs along with a couple of high-tops. The kitchen is semi-open and almost has the look of a walk-up quick service spot. It kind of looks like the space used to be a cafeteria-type place that had counter-service options but now it has been converted to a table-service eatery. \\n\\nThe menu is Mexican inspired with quesadillas, tacos, guac, etc. We were there on a Sunday during brunch time and as such they advertised their bottomless brunch - the price was right so we went for it. I decided to get chicken tacos; these were pretty good - two generously sized tacos with some sauce to go on top. They didn\\'t have the biggest flavor but weren\\'t awful either - though they were a bit on the greasy side. The chips and guac were pretty good - again not amazing (chips from a bag) but just fine. I enjoyed the drinks - the bellini and mimosa were as good as any other brunch place I\\'d been to and their white sangria was quite tasty. \\n\\nService was good, all the staff we interacted with were friendly - overall not the best place I\\'ve been to for brunch but it wasn\\'t awful. You kind of have to take it as it is; they\\'re inside a museum so I don\\'t know if going all out and being super on-trend is what they\\'re trying to convey. Either way, there aren\\'t too many sit-down places in the vicinity so if you\\'re museum hopping this is a good option to stop and grab some food.\",3,2018-04-15,40.8466508,-73.8785937\\nGround Central,Emanuel C.,\"Super polite, they were getting ready to close when I walked in but treated me like the first customer of the day.

They were even having some funny banter but incorporated me into the conversation as opposed to continuing in a manner that would have made a customer feel like we\\'re interrupting them. \\n\\nI wasnt 100 sure what I wanted. I just needed caffeine, he read my face well and made some suggestions and made me a perfect caramel macchiato with a double shot. I have a sweet tooth.

The sturgeon was oily with a sharp sea tang that wasn\\'t overwhelmed by the cream cheese, and there was just the right amount of it.

I don\\'t know if they have switched management or just got their act together, but I have found myself going here at least once a week. It\\'s pretty much the only bagel and coffee place in the immediate area, so it\\'s a go-to for the time being. \\n\\nI still don\\'t order bagels with cream cheese here, but my boyfriend does and says that they have gotten better about not slathering it with excessive cream cheese when you ask them not to. My favorite thing to get is a pumpernickel bagel with lox. The bagels are always fresh, and the lox is just as fresh and high-quality as similar places in Midtown and the UES. The upside is that while places in those neighborhood charge upwards of $13.00 for a lox bagel, Bagel Tree prices theirs at a very reasonable $7.00.\\n\\nThe only thing I\\'ll dock points for is that their coffee is very overpriced. A medium iced latte is about $5.00, and the coffee sometimes tastes stale. They should either drop those prices or improve the product. \\n\\n---------------\\nRight around the corner and I still won\\'t go back. When I say \"\"light cream cheese\"\" I don\\'t mean \"\"glob it on until it reaches critical mass\"\". So much spread on my bagel that it squirted all over my handbag and my clothes. Disgusting! I had to throw it in the garbage. \\n\\nSame goes for my boyfriend\\'s order. He requested light butter and when he pulled out his bagel, it was dripping in buttery slop.

I\\'ve tried them twice (in Sept 2017 and July 2018), and both times they were very greasy (even compared to other croissants), and moreover the insides had huge hollows. I definitely agree with the other review saying that the pastries are \"\"very oily\"\" as I have experienced this on both of my visits. I don\\'t know if I just happened to get unlucky on the days I visited, but the chances of this happening on two visits several months apart seem pretty slim, and I would hope for consistent quality at a place like this. On the plus side, they have a good butter flavor and are pretty flaky. 2.5/5 for plain croissants.\\n\\nI\\'ve also tried the almond croissant once (last September). It was on the inexpensive side ($3.75) and is less heavy than most traditional almond croissants, with a small amount of not-too-sweet marzipan-like filling. In my opinion this was better than the plain croissant here, but I don\\'t think I would get it again.

In fact, I think you can get (at least for the dish I had) the same quality and amount of food from one of the many Asian food trucks near Columbia\\'s campus . . . at a lower price.

It\\'s not really cheating if its all located in Queens right? (#1) I\\'m here so often that I feel like I should have the dukedom or paying rent. Their bagels are so good that I can\\'t go a week without coming by at least once.\\n\\nIn the mornings, I always expect a line of some kind. On the weekends it might be out the door between 7-9am. There as much seating as the average cafe and ideal for solo eaters and coffee dates. Calling ahead of time is never a bad thing, just make sure to show up earlier so the bagels don\\'t get cold.\\n\\nI haven\\'t had a bad bagel yet. Whether it\\'s wheat, oni onion, sesame, raisin, or an everything bagel, I love it toasted with some lox and cream cheese. The latter comes in such a variety that just choosing one can be a task. The flavors are so vast that it can be overwhelming, even for folks who have been here multiple times. When in doubt, sample them all. Every concoction is worth trying. Don\\'t sleep on the flavor of the month, oftentimes it\\'s a flavor not often used.\\n\\nOf course they have more than bagels. They also serve breakfast wraps and sandwiches that are hearty and loaded. The hungry man is my favorite since they stuff the wrap with chunks of avocado, sausage, eggs, cheese, and hashbrown patties. \\xa0Their coffee is also worthy and goes well with any of their bagels.\\n\\nLastly the service is always on point. I\\'ve always been impressed at how efficiently and quickly they serve folks and somehow manage to smile all throughout.

Once again, I ordered a plain toasted bagel with nova and onion. Once again the bagel was crappy and they didn\\'t toast it nearly enough. Add to that the fact that they gave me raw white onion instead of the requisite red onion (which I asked for!) made for a bad sandwich. The only positive was that the salmon was pretty good quality, albeit a bit fatty for my taste.

It was generous on chocolate but the croissant itself was doughy and chewy as if it has been out for over a day.\\n\\nNotes: Spacious and clean location with a clean bathroom. Lots of seating, free WiFi and some outlets for those who need to charge up. Prices did seem less expensive than Starbucks, which is a couple blocks away. The second time, the service was great.

Most recently, the prepared foods. I went to grab some lunch for the park and noticed, somehow for the first time, how good all of their prepared food looks. I also got the pastrami sandwich for the park - yum! Side note: it\\'s a little weird where to get what if you\\'re trying to get a sandwich. Online they have a menu for the cafe which doesn\\'t match the menu at the cafe. And then there are some items on that online menu in the store itself. Maybe this is all due to covid? Not sure. Anyway, prepared foods. Went back to get something for dinner. Ended up with pork chop, creamed spinach, and Israeli salad. All were excellent! A few quick minutes for the pork chop in the oven, and spinach on the stove. Pictures attached!\\n\\nThere are definitely some things you won\\'t be able to find.

The service is good, the atmosphere is relaxed and simple, the food and portions are pretty good.

Both were less than $10 a piece, so its not terribly expensive place to grab food. \\n\\nI liked the xiaolong bao we got. They were plump and delicious. Really filling. soup came out piping hot, and the flavors on point. Also loved their special chicken dumplings, those were nice and not too spicy. My biggest complaint would probably be the small portions, and the sauce was slightly too sweet for my taste. \\n\\nTaro milkshake was really appreciated as a complimentary gift for dining at this new restaurant. Personally, I\\'d prefer my boba a little less sweet, but I guess its pretty standard taro bubble tea in the city.\",4,2019-09-19,40.7896239,-73.9598939\\nHamilton Deli,Monica K.,\"If you don\\'t mind being disrespected, then spend your hard earned money here! The cashier is extremely rude! My colleague and I ordered our food and stepped outside. The space is small and it is hard to social distance. We waited about 15 minutes. Five of those minutes were spent watching our orders sit on the counter next to the coffee machine. When I inquired about our orders, she insisted that we get back on line to pay. When I asked why, she sharply replied, let me know when you get back in line! I left the food and went to Strokos on the next corner where my business is appreciated. Hamilton\\'s cashier seems to think they\\'re the only game in town! It\\'s a deli. Nothing exotic. Hamilton\\'s have received many negative comments about customer service dating back to 2016.

The bagels are good and I\\'m a fan of the cream cheese. They have messed up very simple orders in the past though. They also take a long time to prepare the food.

Sometimes there\\'s a line, and sometimes there is not. The associates are very pleasant and helpful when making a selection. I usually get the sprinkle cookie, that delivers a nice amount of sugary sweetness and a hint of coconut. Their famed black and white cookie was \"\"okay\"\". A little too sweet for me. It reminds me of a really sweet vanilla cake, with thick, super sweet, sheet frosting. If you\\'re in the area, I\\'d recommend checking them out.

It\\'s composed of around 5-6 wide, long benches covered with rugs on a patio, with heated lamps above each. There are tables between the benches to perch your drinks and bags (we just put our tray on the actual bench for convenience). My friend and I shared a bench, and chilled for a bit.\\n\\nShe had the Traditional Cardamom (Hot $6.50) and I had the Sulaimani Chai (Hot $6.50). At first I was surprised at how small the cup was, but eventually I was wow\\'d by the flavors! The Sulaimani looked like regular black tea but it was slightly sweet and had a deep, comforting flavor. My friend liked her Cardamom chai (had milk). These drinks definitely hit the spot on a chilly night! We asked about indoor seating, and the barista said it was open on a reservation basis.

The other option was a grilled cheese, so instead I went for some Peanut Butter on Walnut Raisin Bread ($2.50). Peanut butter can pretty much make anything taste amazing, so I wasn\\'t really that impressed that this little sandwich happened to taste good. It was still disappointing though that the bread was not hot.\\n\\nThe bread here all looks really good.

Fell flat for me.\\n\\nThis is in the literal sense. Perhaps all the hype is around the brioche bun, but when I bit into it, the bun actually collapsed from lack of structural integrity. My teeth encountered the thick-slab bacon (which was delicious!) but then the bacon risked pulling out and leaving behind the egg and cheese. The fried egg was also texturally anonymous somehow, maybe because I suspect it was a single egg and the crispy edge was overly softened in the sandwich. And even if it was gourmet American cheese, the meltiness had nothing to hold together. In summary, the sandwich was bacon.\\n\\nService is nice. Decor is very modern.

It was my little weekend ritual, with a pot of tea and the NYT crossword puzzle. Then I went through a phase where I deemed bagels too bread-y (I know, total idiot) and stopped my bagel consumption very abruptly. Lately, the bagel craving has been back with a vengeance. \\n\\nThis is probably the most convenient location to get a bagel from my vantage point, though there\\'s also Zabar\\'s a few blocks down. I\\'m a big fan of the bagel selection and customization, everything from bialy\\'s to their option of getting your bagel scooped if you don\\'t want too much carbs at once. \\n\\nI went with the standard of lox and cream cheese. From a structural perspective, the bagel was put together nicely, generous slathering of cream cheese on all corners instead of just plopped in the middle. I particularly like it when places put so much cream cheese that it forms a little plug in the middle. When I had my first NYC bagel, I was horrified at the inch of cream cheese dolloped on top but now I\\'m quite used to eating the cream cheese with a side of bagel. My only complaints are that the bagel could have been a bit more toasted and, for a $15+ bagel, I would have preferred more than the 2-3 shavings of salmon that I got. \\xa0\\n\\nI also threw in a blueberry muffin to hit the delivery minimum. So they offer the option of a regular muffin versus a mini muffin. I went with the regular muffin because, well, if I\\'m going to carbo load, I\\'m going all the way. The bag was suspiciously light when I picked it up and opened it to find a bag of two mini muffins instead of the muffin behemoth one would expect for $4.\",4,2020-06-15,40.7127281,-74.0060152\\nHandcraft Coffee,Alison F.,\"Went here with my friend for a quick bit of coffee.

So even though there are a ton of people waiting, they seem to be well staffed and get everything out pretty quickly. They have a well organized system where you wait outside once you place your order and they call names over a speaker. The inside looks pretty basic, but they have an extensive menu.\\n\\nI got a whole wheat everything bagel with lox-cream cheese and capers. The toppings on the bagel were more consistent with a multigrain bagel than a whole wheat everything bagel. The bagel itself had good flavor, however, it was VERY thin. It didn\\'t have the classic New York thickness. The lox cream cheese was good, but a tad bit on the salty side.

I\\'ve never gotten bread from them that I didn\\'t enjoy. But this Yelp page is for their brick-and-mortar location in La Marqueta, so I will be reviewing that. I hate writing this because the girls that work there are sweet, but this place is, to quote a previous review, \"\"an operational disaster\"\". Is it because they are putting so much effort into the greater reaches of the organization that they can\\'t be bothered to do anything with this little counter?\\n\\nThe coffee is terrible. It\\'s 2016 and they don\\'t have any non-dairy milk for those that are lactose intolerant or dairy-free. It\\'s often stale.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are prepared differently every single time I go - training the counter staff on consistency does not seem to be a priority.\\n\\nI\\'ve shown up an hour past opening and no one was there, and the security guard who works in La Marqueta could only give me a shrug. \\n\\n*HBK! COME ON!* Having a stall like this in La Marqueta is incredibly important for this neighborhood. You could have the best coffee and snacks in the neighborhood - your product is already fantastic! You are clearly the only destination stall in La Marqueta, make it count! It\\'s offensive that us East Harlem residents are treated to this when you are clearly putting so much more effort into how the product is marketed at the Greenmarkets! Some suggestions:\\n\\n- Get a locally roasted coffee! What about Uptown Roasters?\\n\\n- Update your menu and teach the staff how to make an avocado toast! (If you\\'re gonna have avocado toast on your menu, it\\'s weird to serve it as a mashed avocado sandwich served between two cold slices of bread. Virtually unheard of.)\\n\\n- That amazing jam you\\'re selling below the register? Can you serve it on one of your amazing breads? \\n\\n- Offer slices of all of your product! This is your flagship. Allow people to try everything you make so they will remember how amazing the bread is and buy it the next time they pass through a market. Offer slices for $2, even, toasted with butter. Anything that allows us to taste your product without having to turn it into a grilled cheese.\",2,2015-12-10,41.9287812,-74.0023702\\nOK Cafe,Michelle D.,\"This has become one of my favorite local coffee shops.

Maybe that\\'s why they got wooden tables, hoping that the table would absorb the dirt, but NO IT DID NOT.

More than anything about the coffee or products, which are average, ACP just doesn\\'t feel like part of the neighborhood fabric -- it seems to exist solely for gentrifiers. Each time I\\'ve visited, the counter staff and nearly all of the patrons were white or Asian. Prices are uniformly about a dollar higher than other spots in the neighborhood, and cash is only accepted until 2pm. Service is hit or miss, it feels judgy rather than welcoming. This is unusual for Central Harlem, where even staff at bodegas and take out spots will greet you, ask how you\\'re doing, joke with you, etc. \\n\\nUnstable tables are a pet peeve, and both of the back tables are majorly wobbly and not fixable with napkins. The chairs are uncomfortably narrow and metal. Working at a table at ACP for an hour was infuriating, despite the solid wifi connection. \\xa0\\n\\nMy double espresso was weak and seemed more like a single than a double size-wise. My friend\\'s special flavored latte was good, but we were perplexed by the glass it was served it. (What\\'s wrong with a mug? What does ACP have against handles?)\\n\\nSkip ACP.

All of the baked goods are made fresh that day. He emphasized, no left overs! There were also vegan options as well. \\n\\nWe got the following:\\n\\nQBH Candy Bar- It\\'s very dense and heavy. It\\'s exactly like an adult version of a candy bar. The hints of sea salt add an ultra sophistication to the dessert.

It\\'s really good if you enjoy coffee. \\n\\nHoney Pistachio Eclair- Hub enjoyed the combination and texture of browned honey with pistachio glaze. The sesame brittle overpowers the eclair a bit. I tried tasting it without the brittle. And I liked that version much better. \\xa0\\n\\nBlood Orange Cheesecake- My absolute favorite out of all the pastries. The cheesecake was so good. It had a nice layer of blood orange jelly. Definitely recommend this one!\\n\\nDonut- it had a sugary texture on top with salty chocolate filling. The filling was a bit salty for me.

The espresso was not too bitter and the milk was creamy enough for being skim. Shortly after, our food arrived. \\n\\nAbsolutely delicious. We both ordered french toast, which is made with the milk bread from the bakery. You are given two very thick, generous slices stacked on top of each other. I had the mascarpone cream and mixed berry jam [$16] so mine had some powdered sugar and sliced strawberries for garnish. I appreciate that the mascarpone cream is served in a little cup [with butter] on the side. I hate when the cream and butter melt before I\\'ve even dug in. The jam is also served on the side. Gratefully, I didn\\'t feel like a cow after I had finished. The french toast was as light as french toast could be.\\n\\nMy boyfriend had the bacon, swiss, and egg [$18] which seemed way larger than my serving, mostly because of the runny egg on top. I sampled his, it was as equally delicious as mine. Even better in fact, because you could taste the salty sweet nuance of the milk bread. \\xa0\\n\\nWe also ordered the home fries [$7] which are not home fries at all, but thick potato wedges with garlic aioli on the side.

Two, the quality and freshness of their ingredients is above par, and three - their menu is so different with cool combinations of different flavors! \\n\\nOrdered the Mediterranean Sandwich today and I CANNOT GET ENOUGH. I love the crazy combo of fresh mozzarella, fried egg, tons of veggies (avocado, cucumber, onion, tomato) and gorgeous field greens with a spread of hummus. On top is a kick ass garlic basil sauce that packs an awesome punch of acidity that makes the sandwich sing! Also, the fact that it comes on a delectable ciabatta roll is really important - a sandwich is nothing without good bread! Oh, and the sandwich is HUGE. \\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the egg white wrap (you get to choose the type of wrap and he chose the spinach) and he was also very surprised at how yummy it was. Nothing really has been blowing us away these days but this wrap really did... the chipotle mayo and hummus combo on it was his favorite part!

Price point of sandwiches on avg. are ~$14, but are pretty big and hearty ( SEE PICS). As far as sammies go, I have so far tried the BELIEF, GREENPOINTER, \\xa0ROB and the SPENCER ( sometimes too pepper heavy for my tastes). Typically I order the ROB and SPENCER and I\\'m sure one day will explore more of the menu, but for right now, those two work and are my go tos. I prefer them toasted, as I am not super close to the restaurant and it sometimes helps w the inevitable \\'sog\\' that may happen w a traveling sandwich w so many wet ingredients.\\n\\nInteresting menu offerings as \\xa0in addition to breakfast and lunch sandwiches they also offer some Italian fare. Mozzarella sticks, burrata based sandwiches, rice balls, etc and also have some latin inclusions w churros as a dessert option.\\nI have also tried the rice balls ( can pass on those... I have had better arancini), strawberry churros ( a tasty indulgence whether filled or not ) and tater tots ( but who can go wrong w tater tots) \\xa0\\nI have only ever had delivery so I cannot speak to the attitude of the team, but what I can say is that I did once call to ask a request of the establishment to include more of their menu on the Uber Eats platform and he was kind enough to explain why it was not quite updated with all of their offerings, but mentioned that the restaurant is in the process of revisiting this. No tone or sass, but a generally friendly sounding dude. \\nI can also say that w the exception of one occurrence out of MANY orders placed, the staff adheres to notes, which I appreciate because let\\'s be real, we hate when there is a section for notes and no one reads and follows feasible requests. \\xa0\\nI also think that they pay attention to reoccurring clientele as once in a while I will find an addtl sweet treat sent along with my order, which is pretty dang thoughtful.

For my visit, I ordered the Dong Jing Rice Bowl, which is served with beef, onion, scallions, cheddar cheese, and topped with a fried egg. I cannot say that I was blown away by the dish. It was not bad, but it was not anything that I would need to have again. In fact, I think you can get (at least for the dish I had) the same quality and amount of food from one of the many Asian food trucks near Columbia\\'s campus . . . at a lower price. Maybe the quality of ingredients used by Wu & Nussbaum are superior to the nearby food trucks\\', but the end end result was pretty much the same . . . at least to my hungover tastebuds. ;) \\xa0That said, the price tag for many of the Asian items are not that outrageous compared to the prices of the nearby Asian food trucks.

I\\'ve walked by hundreds of times and noticed one day a new sign outside advertising $1 samosas (I believe now $1.25) so I stopped in on a whim. \\n\\nThe owner was so unbelievably friendly and welcoming and very grateful for the business. They opened at the beginning of the year and had to close for a few months right off the bat due to COVID.\\n\\nI\\'ve been several times since and Sonni keeps adding new Indian dishes to the menu. \\n\\nChicken curry ($7.99) is a milder yellow curry and not oily at all. I\\'ve had it twice and once it was chicken with bones (my preference) and the other time it was chicken breast cubes. \\n\\nPaneer chili ($7.50) is Sonni\\'s take on a fusion, with paneer cubes, onions, red and green bell peppers in a medium spicy sauce. \\n\\nChanna masala ($7.50) is good. Chickpeas simmered with tomatoes and spices. I generally find channa masala good wherever I get it (it\\'s hard to mess up).\\n\\nButter chicken was a bit more oily (obvious, given it\\'s made with butter) and more spicy and salty than the other chicken curry.\\n\\nEgg vindaloo ($7.50) comes with two hard boiled eggs and potatoes in a spicy curry. Tried it last night and it\\'s one of my favorites now.\\n\\nThe samosa chaat ($4) is a clear winner for me. It\\'s a broken up samosa with a chickpea or pea curry on top, with tamarind and cilantro chutney, raita (yogurt), spices, onion, green peppers, and spices and garam (chickpea flour/flakes). It takes a bit more time to make but it\\'s so delicious. \\n\\nSavor is now my go-to for friendly service and delicious food in the neighborhood. Will be back a bunch more! If anything, go for the $1.25 samosa and let Sonni put a smile on your face. They are still adding Indian specials to their menu so be prepared for some inconsistency as they figure it out, but that won\\'t take away from the experience.\",5,2020-10-04,40.7896239,-73.9598939\\nTal Bagels,Destiny A.,Great bagels.

Another hour later I call and they say they can reimburse me for the fries, now three hours after the original order!\\n\\nI\\'d say there are mistakes about 50% of orders.

I hate writing this because the girls that work there are sweet, but this place is, to quote a previous review, \"\"an operational disaster\"\".

You are clearly the only destination stall in La Marqueta, make it count! It\\'s offensive that us East Harlem residents are treated to this when you are clearly putting so much more effort into how the product is marketed at the Greenmarkets! Some suggestions:\\n\\n- Get a locally roasted coffee! What about Uptown Roasters?\\n\\n- Update your menu and teach the staff how to make an avocado toast! (If you\\'re gonna have avocado toast on your menu, it\\'s weird to serve it as a mashed avocado sandwich served between two cold slices of bread. Virtually unheard of.)\\n\\n- That amazing jam you\\'re selling below the register? Can you serve it on one of your amazing breads? \\n\\n- Offer slices of all of your product! This is your flagship. Allow people to try everything you make so they will remember how amazing the bread is and buy it the next time they pass through a market. Offer slices for $2, even, toasted with butter.

I got the Dan Dan Noodles and was very disappointed at the portion size. It costs about $10 and I was under the impression that it would be a full meal but really felt like more of an appetizer. Didn\\'t taste that authentic either and the peanut sauce was just okay. It was labeled as spicy but I wouldn\\'t consider it super spicy. \\n\\nDon\\'t know if I\\'d ever come back just because the upper west side is so far from me. Most of the reviews are positive about the bagels so just keep that in mind when ordering from here.\",2,2019-10-26,40.6501038,-73.9495823\\nNathan’s Famous,Happy S.,\"My kids love this place. \\xa0If you are looking for Par Se, you will be disappointed. \\xa0But if you want a comfortable neighborhood place to sit down at OR to take out Nathan\\'s burgers or hot dogs or chicken fingers, this place works well. \\xa0Management is connected to the adjacent bagel place, and they have a broader selection of deli sandwiches and drinks. \\xa0Not your typical Nathan\\'s fast food- this place has extra level and I like it.\",5,2019-02-10,40.7896239,-73.9598939\\nThe Chai Spot,Vanessa E.,\"This place is so cute and chill.

We occasionally get bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches, but our usual order is two toasted everything bagels with cream cheese and they are some of the best bagels we\\'ve ever had.

I mainly come for the bagels, so I usually try to get here in the morning. I like getting the egg salad, as it\\'s not too bad here. However, more recently I\\'ve been getting the nussbaum classic but without capers and light cream cheese. They\\'re usually pretty good at keeping it on the light side of cream cheese, so they do care about getting your order right.

If you\\'re looking for more of a meal, you can get one of the sandwiches which include things like eggs.

I\\'ve tried them twice (in Sept 2017 and July 2018), and both times they were very greasy (even compared to other croissants), and moreover the insides had huge hollows. I definitely agree with the other review saying that the pastries are \"\"very oily\"\" as I have experienced this on both of my visits. I don\\'t know if I just happened to get unlucky on the days I visited, but the chances of this happening on two visits several months apart seem pretty slim, and I would hope for consistent quality at a place like this. On the plus side, they have a good butter flavor and are pretty flaky. 2.5/5 for plain croissants.\\n\\nI\\'ve also tried the almond croissant once (last September). It was on the inexpensive side ($3.75) and is less heavy than most traditional almond croissants, with a small amount of not-too-sweet marzipan-like filling. In my opinion this was better than the plain croissant here, but I don\\'t think I would get it again.

A group of about 8 women (some with very little English skills) arrived one by one, got their work authorizations checked, and waited for the group interview, orientation, and tour to begin. \\xa0I got to witness a brief peek into how this all works! \\xa0I have no idea how often they do initial interviewing.\\n\\nTo share at home, I picked up: \\n-- Nan-e Quadi ($3ea x2, \"\"A rich, creamy Persian sweetbread made with milk and honey and topped with sesame seeds.

Traditionally eaten for breakfast with honey, it\\'s also great with lamb and onions.\"\")\\n-- Nan-e Barbari ($4ea x4 halves, \"\"A savory Persian flatbread with a chewy crust, topped with black and white sesame seeds.\"\")\\n-- Bialy ($2ea x2, \"\"Classic New York breakfast roll filled with caramelized onions and poppy seeds and baked directly on the hearth.\"\")\\n-- Macadamia Nut Cookies ($2.75 for a 2-pack) for my little cookie monster waiting on the UWS!\\n\\nMy Persian husband was not super enthused about the Quadi and Barbari-- he felt the Barbari was a little too thick and dense and I tend to agree. \\xa0In my experience from authentic Iranian bakeries in the US, Canada, and Iran it is true that Barbari tends to be a little more delicate than that of HBK\\'s. \\xa0But we both went bananas over the M\\'smen which we shared for breakfast the next morning drizzled with honey-- reminded us of all those amazing and elaborate Moroccan breakfasts we had during a trip there ten years ago! \\xa0The bialy\\'s tasted good to me, but I\\'m not sure I\\'ve ever had one before so unsure what they are \"\"supposed\"\" to taste like. \\xa0And my little one gobbled up those mac nut cookies and didn\\'t even complain about the lack of chocolate (usually a must for her!)\\n\\nMy total came to $39.25 for lunch and all the take-home goodies, which I thought was a pretty nice deal for this city. \\xa0All in all, a place I will support again the next time I am in the city!!\",5,2016-05-25,47.6038321,-122.3300624\\nSuperior Cafe,Peter K.,\"So much HATE for this place. \\n\\nI\\'ll admit, the men that work here, especially the Hispanic ones behind the salad and sandwich counter, are downright rude.

As simple as sandwiches can be, not everyone does them right, and yes, even sandwiches can be made with love. Compton\\'s got their sandwich game down. Let me explain...\\n\\nThere are tons of bodegas around NYC who have sandwich menus, where you can (and girl, I have) order mediocre sandwiches. It gets the job done in terms of satisfying your hunger, but places like Compton\\'s come into play, when you want a sandwich that is both filling, AND f*cking delicious. Not to mention, they invest in atmosphere, and give you all the feels of Compton itself, with the hip hop music and dope decor. \\n\\nI ordered three of their sandwiches and they ALL get five stars from me......periodT! I started with The Rob hero, which is simply a turkey sandwich with avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato, red onion and lime aioli. I don\\'t know where they got this turkey from, but something about it just hit different! It was tender and delicious. As simple as a turkey sandwich can be, The Rob shows that it can be elevated and taken to another level. I ordered extra lime aioli, and girl, I\\'m glad I did. Next up, I ordered the sticky tender hero, which tasted like I was eating buffalo wings. It had the perfect spice, and that bleu cheese dressing that slapped! The chicken tenders were just that....tender, well-breaded, well-seasoned. Damn. The last sandwich I got was the burrata cheesesteak, which excited me, solely for the reason of it being made with burrata. It was truly a Philly cheesesteak....with burrata lol. I do wish that I got \\nsome truffle flavor on there from the truffle balsamic glaze, but I mean, it was delicious regardless. \\n\\nYou can tell that someone sat down, and carefully crafted each recipe for these sandwiches. You taste the effort in each one, and there isn\\'t an ingredient on any of them that didn\\'t belong. You want a bomb ass sandwich?

I found fabulous, large avocados recently for $1 each, organic heirloom grape tomatoes for about $2.50 a pint. Five oz. clamshells of organic greens are usually about $3.50. \\n\\n- The owners (or folks I presume to be owners) are charming and kind to human and canine pups. \\n\\n- They stock a fun assortment of random, delicious products, ranging from good olive oil and halva and fresh dates in season, to teeny little Petit Suisse six-packs, well priced cheeses and milk, fresh bread, and (Dominican?) cakes and desserts. The store has a lot of wonderful little nooks and crannies to explore. \\n\\n- I enjoy detouring on evening and weekend dog walks to stroll by and check out the sidewalk stand for beautiful, ripe tomatoes, a bag of clementines -- or just a giant 50 lb. pumpkin for a pittance around Halloween. \\n\\nThe one big damper on an otherwise lovely place are the often surly cashiers. I don\\'t know what\\'s going on, there. They don\\'t seem like deep-down mean people, but for whatever reason, these folks are not happy and that\\'s reflected in how they interact with customers. Some take personal cell phone calls and ignore customers, despite the fact that the line is snaking out the door or around the corner. (I get it if it\\'s an emergency, but the instances I\\'ve seen didn\\'t seem to be.) I usually bring my own cloth bag, and for some reason, this sometimes elicits eye rolling and deep sighs. \\n\\nDespite these flaws in paradise, Mani Market is still about six trillion times better than the nearby D\\'Agostinos, and nicely supplements our Whole Foods / Trader Joe\\'s excursions.

It\\'s a slight upgrade on your typical inner city bodega.\\n\\nThey\\'re open 24/7 and have a slightly larger selection than most bodegas.

Colorful tile work, bright lighting, and flat screens highlight the slightly \\'upscale\\' nature of the establishment.\\n\\nThey make cold and hot prepared foods including sandwiches, paninis, salads, burgers, Gyro, and Chicken/Lamb over rice. They also claim to feature a juice and smoothie bar.\\n\\nAdditionally, I was told by management they plan to deliver via Eat24, GrubHub, and Seamless in the coming weeks. \\n\\nIf they continue to offer good selection, quality food at good prices, and remain open 24/7 then they\\'re pretty good in my book. \\n\\nWelcome to Harlem Eleganza Deli Gourmet.

After a few appointments there, I began to eye this place and was very excited to see another beautifully renovated storefront in El Barrio. Unfortunately, that\\'s all this place is.\\n\\nI visited during their Grand Opening event week on a Friday where the special of the night was 25% off of their craft beer selection. The first issue I had was with their drink pricing - there are no prices anywhere. With 25% off, each beer came to almost $8 which means on the regular they are around $10. I don\\'t think the selections, stuff like Lagunitas and Alagash warrant that pricing. We had 3 beers each at the bar. \\n\\nWe got a little hungry, and I took that as an opportunity to order some food which is advertised as a Latin/Mediterranean. We ordered the Shrimp and Tostones, as well as the Sweet Potato Fries. The Shrimp and Tostones was described as Jumbo Shrimp served with oversized Tostones for $25. At that price point, because as a Puerto Rican I know that Plantains cost cents on the dollar, I was expecting some COLLOSSAL shrimp. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t receive jumbo shrimp at all. They were normal sized. The Tostones were cooked well, but overall everything on the plate was salty, including the unidentified sauce served with it. The sweet potato fries were pretty good. \\n\\nThe vibe was missing... authenticity. I expected to hear some salsa, or Mediterranean music but instead was bombarded with pop hits. The only nice things to see and hear we\\'re the many people congratulating the owners on their accomplishments (because come on... it\\'s hard as hell to start a family restaurant business in the city). Otherwise, I found the decor to be pretty basic. Nothing stood out to me as different, or representative of the owner\\'s culture. \\n\\nTL;DR Barcha has set them selves up to be one of the most expensive restaurants in the neighborhood, which I don\\'t believe is warranted right now. The food was disappointing and on the salty side.

It has a cool exterior and a solid layout. They don\\'t have table service but you order at the counter and they bring it to you. On first glance the menu looks solid until they tell you they are out of half the things on there. They have everything from acai bowls to flavored popcorn. It is eclectic to say the least.\\n\\nHeres the 2nd problem. It is right next to the train and every time the train passes on the platform above you literally can\\'t hear the person across from you talk. It is loud since the windows were open.\\n\\nWith all that being said the acai bowl was pretty good. The acai had a perfect texture and the fruit was fresh. No complaints only compliments. The shrimp tacos were messy and came in a cool presentation but did not taste fresh. The lady did mention a lot of items like the salads are pre-made so you can\\'t make many changes to the dish. \\n\\nI also tried the popcorn which is a good snack.

It has been opened for less than a week. The place has a very nice decor to it and lots of open space/seating and natural light. I really had high hopes for this place. I was originally going to give them 4* but the way they handled our service, our friends service, and just eavesdropping on the service of other patrons, it forced me to give this place 3*.\\n\\nI had no issues with their food. I thought their bagels were good. I tried their cinnamon raisin bagel and garlic bagel. I had them toasted and both bagels still tasted great. I had cinnamon raisin walnut cream cheese in the cinnamon raisin bagel and I did not think it was overly sweet. For the garlic bagel, I had the lox cream cheese on it. The lox cream cheese wasn\\'t bad but in my opinion, the lox flavor wasn\\'t strong enough. I think this particular spread is better at other locations.\\n\\nI also ordered iced coffee with vanilla and the drink just came out to be too sweet. Please dial it back.\\n\\nIn terms of service, there was no problems placing the order. The issue was the communication. One person took our orders and a different person prepared our bagels. Unfortunately, the person making our bagel would sometimes forget what we had ordered so would ask us again what we ordered. This wasn\\'t so bad but it was confounded by the fact that it happened to a lot of customers. In addition, a lot of times, the wrong bagel was made and even after telling them it was made in correctly, the supposedly \"\"fixed\"\" bagel was sometimes incorrectly made again. I was very patient with them but I knew a lot of other patrons were not. The good thing is that they were more than willing to rectify the mistake. \\n\\nMy suggestion to them is either change the system in how things are ordered and made OR use a check list menu type system where the patrons tick of boxes as to what they want so that menu can act as the order ticket and everyone will know what is ordered. This will greatly minimize the mistakes being made. If it is the case that the workers have extremely short term memory, another suggestion would be to hire workers with better memories.\\n\\nAnother suggestion would be to move the hanging menus forward/closer to the ordering counter so everyone can see. The font on the menu isn\\'t big enough to be so far back. I don\\'t need a test of my eyesight while trying to order breakfast.\\n\\nOne last suggestion is to put the store hours somewhere. I have not been successful in finding the store hours.\\n\\nI know this is their 1st week of opening and I completely understand these issues/woes of a new opening. I plan on coming back in 1 month because I do believe that this store can do well. I hope in the interim, some of these issues will have been resolved. \\n\\nThis place is such a great location for a bagel shop and it\\'s a welcomed alternative to dunkin donuts around the corner and starbucks across the street.

There is truly nothing better than that local store who knows exactly what you want when you pop in at 2 pm or 2am. By now I was thoroughly convinced that there was nothing like this by me though, it has been a while after all. Well it turns out that I take the same way home from the subway every time, and if I had only turned in one block sooner I would have been in blissful sandwich land from day one (as opposed to day 751). That mistake was rectified on the 4th of July thanks to some kids with some loud fireworks. I mean, who doesn\\'t want to see teenagers blow themselves up..er I mean, wow us with pyrotechnics? Walking towards what I assumed to be a kids last day on earth, I was stunned to find what appeared to be a shiny, clean bodega. Even in my semi (ok very) buzzed state, I made a mental note to come back here, if only to see if I were hallucinating.

Otherwise noooo other place has hot food, a salad bar, juice/smoothie options and is clean!! \\n\\nI\\'m usually here for a green juice or a salad. I was HOOKED on their green juices and would literally spend like $30 a week at one point. And then who doesn\\'t like a fresh salad made for you every now and again?! One fine day, I was craving a sausage, egg white and cheese sandwich and it literally disappeared after the first bite. Meaning that ish was good. All the guys here are friendly, the prices are fair, and I\\'m happy to have them in the neighborhood! \\n\\nI have a feeling that the guys just make up the prices in their heads, since I usually add a whole bunch of stuff to my salads but generally the same things and it\\'s always a different price ($6-7). They accept debit/credit which is also a plus AND there\\'s a free water with every salad.

My boyfriend lives nearby so we thought we would pop in for breakfast [notice I didn\\'t say brunch]. This was on a Sunday around 11:30AM, naturally it was crowded and we were quoted a 15-20 minute wait. However, that was for the \"\"kitchen\"\" part of the cafe. We were able to plop right down at a table in the bakery, where you order at the register.\\n\\nThe bakery is tiny. There are probably five tables and that\\'s being generous. Your back will be in someone else\\'s pancakes [they\\'re delicious though!]. You will also need to wear a coat. The door opens frequently and you will feel a stiff wind, whether there is one or not.\\n\\nOur lattes [$5], mine with skim milk, came out first. It was perfect. The espresso was not too bitter and the milk was creamy enough for being skim. Shortly after, our food arrived. \\n\\nAbsolutely delicious. We both ordered french toast, which is made with the milk bread from the bakery. You are given two very thick, generous slices stacked on top of each other. I had the mascarpone cream and mixed berry jam [$16] so mine had some powdered sugar and sliced strawberries for garnish. I appreciate that the mascarpone cream is served in a little cup [with butter] on the side. I hate when the cream and butter melt before I\\'ve even dug in. The jam is also served on the side. Gratefully, I didn\\'t feel like a cow after I had finished. The french toast was as light as french toast could be.\\n\\nMy boyfriend had the bacon, swiss, and egg [$18] which seemed way larger than my serving, mostly because of the runny egg on top. I sampled his, it was as equally delicious as mine. Even better in fact, because you could taste the salty sweet nuance of the milk bread. \\xa0\\n\\nWe also ordered the home fries [$7] which are not home fries at all, but thick potato wedges with garlic aioli on the side. I was pleasantly surprised by this development but I wish they were crispier like the potato wedges at The Common in Brooklyn.\\n\\n$55 in total, before tip. \\n\\nI cannot wait to come back and try the other offerings on the menu and the bakery.\",4,2019-10-30,40.6501038,-73.9495823\\nBagel Express II,Christina K.,\"I frequent this place because it is close to my work. \\xa0Bagels ok but service was never up to par.\\n\\nI called this morning to place an order for delivery and the gentleman on the phone told me to call back because \"\"it\\'s too busy now\"\". \\xa0Patrons calling in aren\\'t customers? \\xa0Real awful service if you ask me.\",1,2019-03-20,40.7498243,-73.7976337\\nEffy’s Cafe,Andrea G.,\"Just happened upon this place looking for a quick bite.

It started in high school, when my mom got it into her head that raisin bran muffins were a health food and so I had one everyday for breakfast. I think we both realized years later that muffins were essentially cupcakes without the frosting but my love for muffins has never dwindled. \\n\\nSo naturally I will gravitate to any place specifically named Muffins Cafe. I have only tried the muffins here. Note there is a section of the menu called \"\"Health Muffins\"\" which I do my very best to avoid. \\n\\nBlueberry: They do the sugar crumb streusel topping perfectly. \\nPumpkin spice: Strong, rich cinnamon and nutmeg flavor; a muffin that I could eat everyday, not just during the fall. \\nBanana walnut: This was a bit of a fail, as the banana seemed blended in rather than in chunks and there was maybe one walnut in total in the whole muffin. \\n\\nThey do have other baked goods (croissants, danishes, bagels, pound cakes) that all looked delicious, as well as salads and sandwiches.

On one hand, here we have a local business during a pandemic, which has altered their ways to provide delicious coffee to us. On the other hand, is $6 remotely reasonable for a cold brew?\\n\\nI ordered a hot nonfat latte. The latte was delicious. The coffee was smooth, and I barely needed any sweetener (i\\'m very sensitive to bitter). My friend ordered cold brew. It too was smooth and a really beautiful cup of coffee, albeit it was half filled with ice for a 16oz portion. \\n\\nThe establishment serves the coffee outside, provides hand sanitizer, and looks like they\\'re taking the pandemic seriously. They are card-only. \\n\\nSo my review ends up at 3-stars. While the coffee was delicious, it was really too pricy to be considered a go-to place. But if you can afford $6 and change per day for a cup, I highly recommend \"\"Hutch\"\" as they call it.\",3,2020-08-06,42.3602534,-71.0582912\\nBagel Tree,Diana P.,\"Good food and good service.

I was not.\\n\\nFirst off, the bagel is tiny. Yes, it is crunchy and chewy, but I feel that it is small, and what is filled inside of it is even smaller. There is barely a layer of lox and cream cheese (the latter is pretty sour too). Considering the price and location (it is on the Upper West Side in a fairly pricey neighborhood), I am surprised how mediocre the experience is. It is an absolutely no frills, bare bones bagel shop. It simply feels out of place given the neighborhood it is in. \\n\\nAs a backup, I also got a plain bagel on whitefish salad, and found the whitefish salad too chunky for my liking. I prefer it smoother, like a spread, and less like a fishy paste.\\n\\nThey do not accept credit cards. No exceptions of any kind, and the staff make it clear to you when you walk in.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a good New York bagel, absolutely skip this one.\",2,2020-11-30,40.7127281,-74.0060152\\nWilliam Greenberg Desserts,Paula O.,\"Little girls\\' children\\'s books often show sweet village scenes.

So . . . . no idea why I haven\\'t written a review for the other but I know I\\'ve been here. Maybe years ago? Anyway, the bagels are just as good as I\\'ve remembered. Absolutely one of my favorite bagels in the entire New York city region. The bagels are massive and have the perfect chew. The cream cheese comes in a pile on your perfect sandwich of dough. The flavors are always unique and keep you coming back. I went for pumpkin cream cheese while I was out in Queens cat sitting this past weekend, knowing my opportunity for returning will probably be ages since I live in Brooklyn and rarely travel boroughs during covid now. I initially ordered the cream cheese on an egg bagel (usually my go to choice among bagels) and one of the workers informed me they actually also have a pumpkin bagel! Well slap me silly. I changed my order to pumpkin/pumpkin quite enthusiastically. It\\'s definitely an interesting bagel. It\\'s covered in toasted pumpkin seeds and the flavor is subtle but great and the texture is just perfect. It\\'s kind of still eggy like an egg bagel so I like that factor. Really you can\\'t go wrong with any of their bagels or sandwich options. The ordering process was also simple. Only maybe 2 or 3 people waiting distanced inside the store for their orders. Which is interesting because the Broadway spot has always had a line any time I used to go there.

I also wasn\\'t able to tell of any fragrant greens or types of onions like scallions, let alone salt or pepper. I\\'m shocked. OK, things happen but why? When you have a successful recipe just follow it. And, as for the oil used, it certainly wasn\\'t \"\"Greek olive-oil\"\" or any olive oil, \\xa0nor \"\"corn oil\"\" like Mazola, but perhaps another \"\"light\"\" version was used like \"\"canola\"\" perhaps?

My teeth encountered the thick-slab bacon (which was delicious!) but then the bacon risked pulling out and leaving behind the egg and cheese. The fried egg was also texturally anonymous somehow, maybe because I suspect it was a single egg and the crispy edge was overly softened in the sandwich.

I didn\\'t taste an essence of anything, maybe at the end or bottom of the drink in my last few sips I almost tasted a hint of rose. But thats it. The only essence I tasted for most of the drink was the oat milk and the coffee.

At that price point, because as a Puerto Rican I know that Plantains cost cents on the dollar, I was expecting some COLLOSSAL shrimp. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t receive jumbo shrimp at all. They were normal sized. The Tostones were cooked well, but overall everything on the plate was salty, including the unidentified sauce served with it. The sweet potato fries were pretty good. \\n\\nThe vibe was missing... authenticity. I expected to hear some salsa, or Mediterranean music but instead was bombarded with pop hits. The only nice things to see and hear we\\'re the many people congratulating the owners on their accomplishments (because come on... it\\'s hard as hell to start a family restaurant business in the city). Otherwise, I found the decor to be pretty basic. Nothing stood out to me as different, or representative of the owner\\'s culture. \\n\\nTL;DR Barcha has set them selves up to be one of the most expensive restaurants in the neighborhood, which I don\\'t believe is warranted right now. The food was disappointing and on the salty side. The happy hour deals on beer are laughable and overall, I don\\'t think I will go back.\",3,2019-10-22,40.7127281,-74.0060152\\nTwo Little Red Hens,Simon W.,\"Brooklyn Blackout!\\n\\nThere\\'s no other place that bests TLRH\\'s Brooklyn Blackout. \\xa0Whether you are getting the cupcake or the cake, this Brooklyn Blackout is so yum. \\xa0The chocolate tones are no doubt rich, sweet, and slightly bitter with a chocolate fudge that is delectable.\\n\\nI\\'m sure the other stuff is good here, including the butter cream based that is super but definitely get the Brooklyn Blackout!\",5,2020-03-05,40.7498243,-73.7976337\\nBrooklyn Bagel & Coffee Company,Tiyana F.,\"I really enjoy Brooklyn Bagel because of the quality of the bagel.

We got the baguette with jam, chocolate chip walnut cookies, and walnut sticky buns- and the $2 tote. Get the tote, folks. It\\'s cute, large, and durable. Also the backdrop to my pastry photo shoot, haha. \\nOkay. So. Everything about the chocolate chip walnut cookie that has been said is true. A pretty life changing cookie- that caramelized, crunchy exterior, with a should-I-be-eating-this style chewy interior. No more room to put more chocolate chips or walnuts. 10/10, have bought again. \\nBut the real star of this review- the baguette with butter and jam. It sounds so stupidly simple because it is. And that\\'s what\\'s so great. It\\'s stupidly simple foods done stupidly well. You know those snobs that go to Europe, then come home and complain to all that will listen about how our bread is so inferior? I think this is the bread they\\'re missing. It\\'s. So. Good. Like- I can\\'t explain how it\\'s different from every other American baguette I\\'ve had, it just.. is. And the raspberry jam isn\\'t just the magenta colored high fructose corn syrup that we call jam or jelly over here. It\\'s done right, and it partially soaks into the lovely baguette to make a delicious carb/fruit sensation. The butter, the final element, is unsalted, and just the kiss of fat that every good piece of bread needs. Probably the best $2.75 I\\'ve spent on food in months- maybe in my time in NYC period.

All the smoked fish was excellent! I bought several kinds, but my fave was the Scottish. The Whitefish salad was fresh and the whole whitefish were plump and delicious. The staff was professional, enthusiastic, kind and polite. I recommend this place wholeheartedly for smoked fish.\",5,2021-01-20,42.0485378,-72.567701\\nDave’s Gourmet,Sherry L.,\"Not gourmet food in the sense of what you would normally consider gourmet, but definitely a staple in the UES! I\\'ve only come here for lunch and tried their paninis, which are fantastic and a great value! I was told that their food is super fresh because everything is prepared the morning of, and I can attest to this. Everything is pretty much made on the spot or looks recently prepared!\\n\\nThe first time, I tried their Thanksgiving panini, which is pretty much a turkey panini with cranberry sauce. Then - after hearing many raving reviews - I finally got around to trying chicken parmesan panini, which was as good as they all say! Unfortunately it is a bit heavy and has no vegetables at all, but it definitely keeps you full and fueled!\\n\\nThere is usually a rush around lunchtime, but the employees are friendly and work fast to fill your order. There is no credit card minimum that I am aware of, which is great, because I don\\'t usually keep cash with me all the time.

They made it with out asking which ones I want, then I asked for an egg (like the picture on the menu) and the guy at the register told the cook twice how I wanted it but the cook decided to add a scrambled egg because \"\"my daughter likes it this way and it\\'s great\"\". Well his daughter and I are not the same. Then I went today to order another item. I get to the register with my drink and he tells me the grill is off, it\\'s 7pm.

If you prefer a cookie that is flat and maybe has some snap or crispiness, go somewhere else. \\nPrice wise, it\\'s going to set you back the same as if you bought treats and coffee from a chain like starbucks.

Ordered a bagel with butter, and they barely put any on.

Bagel and Barista. Barista would suggest there are people who prepare your coffee, but you pour and prepare your own hot coffee. \\nIced is given to you from workers, but have to sweeten yourself. It\\'s not a big deal to do that, but the name would suggest otherwise. Unless, of course, by adding the word Barista to the name, they have dubbed the customer as such. \\nAlso, ordering turkey with egg whites, they always give a different type of turkey. Last week it was Honey Turkey, another time it\\'s Sausalito. Don\\'t mind those types, but just want regular turkey. \\nAgain, the bagels are pretty good, but the people behind the counter don\\'t know much other than how to push buttons on the register. Anything beyond that seems to be bothersome to them. \\nI added a picture of my under-buttered, un-spread sesame bagel. That of which I had to go back in and ask for a spoon to spread it, myself.

For a drink I had the best Pomegranate Nectar, and there are plenty of soft drinks to choose from inside. The samosas were spiced perfectly and my sandwich was so good I would easily get it again. The vegetables and other ingredients were imported from India, so I heard, and I believe it based on the taste. Truly happy we stopped here.

I would take care of this bagel as long as we both shall live. That is how much I loved this bagel.\\n\\nThe location is terrific, right off the 116th street subway station on the B/C subway lines in Harlem. I thought the customer service was really good too, as the cashier was super friendly and patient with me as I asked my dozens of questions as to what was good. I got myself a plain bagel with cream cheese and lox (a good go to).\\n\\nAs the cashier explained, they use 2.5 ounces of lox (nice amount) with cream cheese of my choice on a bagel of my choice. It amounted to $12, very reasonable for the experience.\\n\\nThis bagel is heavenly. It is a little sweet; with the perfect crunch and chew. It is perfect in size, not too big, but not too small. The lox is placed on perfectly as is the cream cheese. It simply looks iconic and tastes the same way. Fresh, neat, fishy, savory, and yet it still carries that New York angst when you carry out that brown paper bag and see your sandwich wrapped in wax paper, the wax paper ready to be torn apart.\\n\\nI was completely happy with this bagel that I was dreaming about it for hours after I finished it.

It was my little weekend ritual, with a pot of tea and the NYT crossword puzzle. Then I went through a phase where I deemed bagels too bread-y (I know, total idiot) and stopped my bagel consumption very abruptly. Lately, the bagel craving has been back with a vengeance. \\n\\nThis is probably the most convenient location to get a bagel from my vantage point, though there\\'s also Zabar\\'s a few blocks down. I\\'m a big fan of the bagel selection and customization, everything from bialy\\'s to their option of getting your bagel scooped if you don\\'t want too much carbs at once. \\n\\nI went with the standard of lox and cream cheese. From a structural perspective, the bagel was put together nicely, generous slathering of cream cheese on all corners instead of just plopped in the middle. I particularly like it when places put so much cream cheese that it forms a little plug in the middle. When I had my first NYC bagel, I was horrified at the inch of cream cheese dolloped on top but now I\\'m quite used to eating the cream cheese with a side of bagel. My only complaints are that the bagel could have been a bit more toasted and, for a $15+ bagel, I would have preferred more than the 2-3 shavings of salmon that I got. \\xa0\\n\\nI also threw in a blueberry muffin to hit the delivery minimum. So they offer the option of a regular muffin versus a mini muffin. I went with the regular muffin because, well, if I\\'m going to carbo load, I\\'m going all the way.

I called up one of my favorite spots and they told me they had take out or I could order from one of those online order services. Never did she mention that the original location was temporary closed, so boy was I surprised to take a trip there and see they were closed and had relocated somewhere else. I was so angry. I still wanted the dumplings, try to call the phone number again but got a busy signal, (four times). So I booked an Uber and drove to the new location and mind you there was no complete address, just the street number. So now I\\'m at 113th and Broadway looking for this place, if this didn\\'t work out I was glad to know that a Shake Shack was near by. I can always go for some cheese fries and a Shack Shake. \\nAnyway finally found the place because it was right on the corner and in the window it said something about La Salle dumplings. \\n\\nFinally I picked up the special chicken dumplings, the Szechuan beef, pork and crab xiao long bao, and a pork belly noodle soup. \\nEverything was delicious. Five stars for all the food, but four stars for the overall experience of what could of been less headache if they would put a number location or the name of this place rather than saying they moved to 113th and Broadway.

As a result, we ordered cappuccinos and decided to sit down for a proper brunch. I ordered the classic eggs benedict and thought it was very tasty and well crafted. The flavor was delicate, the eggs perfectly poached, and a sturdy, slightly toasted muffin underneath, complemented the meal perfectly. In my experience eggs benedict, while seeming simple at first glance, is a bit trickier than you\\'d think in getting it just right. Sugar Hill clearly knows what its doing.

I can make this better.\"\" Instead they say all delivery orders must be made through grub hub or uber. As someone that has spent most of his adult life in the hospitality industry this to me would have been considered totally unacceptable by my superiors. When i finally bike through the rain. I was told there was no manager and no supervisor available for me to speak to. So i began to ven my frustration on the girl taking my order. In hindsight i feel bad. Thats right, I FEEL BAD because your supervisors or mgmt are to cowardly to stand up for thier product.

They go out of their way for me. I have allergies and the employees are very sensitive to my needs. I ask a lot of questions and vary my diet. They are so patient while I decide. \\xa0\\n\\nDuring Covid they have shown me their concern for customer safety. They have kept us fed when times were bad. I was so glad when they brought the buffet back. Since I don\\'t cook it is so important to me. They provide disposable gloves for handling the buffet utensils. They are environmentally conscious regarding their to go containers. \\n\\nCash registers in the back are great. You don\\'t have to sign the receipt. It\\'s got the chip. Your receipt has your order on it so you can double check for accuracy. I\\'m in favor of this modern system. It makes check out quick. \\n\\nThe Environment overall is clean and comfortable. I see them cleaning every morning. They have plenty of staples for preparing your coffee. Lots of pretty flowers and plants decorating the space. The seating is limited so get there early. You can sit outside comfortably weather permitting. The tables are clean. They also have delivery in the surrounding neighborhood. \\n\\nThey haven\\'t had a lot of cashiers come and go lately. I try to get to know them. They have been very pleasant and no issues I can see. You can always count on one of the family members and owners to \\xa0be on hand if you have an issue. \\n\\nThe Food is delicious to me! It\\'s all about the bagel! I thought I was in heaven when I had the bacon, egg, and cheese. I\\'ve never been disappointed with the taste of any flavor bagel or cream cheese. I could eat them everyday. They have so many choices. Lots of breakfast options to try. The sandwiches and other lunch options never disappoint me. BUT most of the time Breakfast is my biggest meal of the day!! I do love their food buffet for lunch too. I\\'m a big fan of the fish and the Spinach Lasagna. Also the fruit is fresh as is everything else. Both Hot and cold food is ready early. \\n\\nSpeaking of eating my biggest meal of the day for breakfast I wish they still opened at 6am. All bagel flavors and employees used to be ready to go!

But Orwashers is doing the damn thing! The morning bun -- my gawd! Talk about power pastry! It deserves all of the accolades. The spelt loaf is ridiculous (in the best sense). It\\'s dense, studded with plump raisins, and that touch of honey comes through just enough to give it just the right kiss of sweetness.

I found fabulous, large avocados recently for $1 each, organic heirloom grape tomatoes for about $2.50 a pint. Five oz. clamshells of organic greens are usually about $3.50. \\n\\n- The owners (or folks I presume to be owners) are charming and kind to human and canine pups. \\n\\n- They stock a fun assortment of random, delicious products, ranging from good olive oil and halva and fresh dates in season, to teeny little Petit Suisse six-packs, well priced cheeses and milk, fresh bread, and (Dominican?) cakes and desserts. The store has a lot of wonderful little nooks and crannies to explore. \\n\\n- I enjoy detouring on evening and weekend dog walks to stroll by and check out the sidewalk stand for beautiful, ripe tomatoes, a bag of clementines -- or just a giant 50 lb. pumpkin for a pittance around Halloween. \\n\\nThe one big damper on an otherwise lovely place are the often surly cashiers. I don\\'t know what\\'s going on, there. They don\\'t seem like deep-down mean people, but for whatever reason, these folks are not happy and that\\'s reflected in how they interact with customers. Some take personal cell phone calls and ignore customers, despite the fact that the line is snaking out the door or around the corner. (I get it if it\\'s an emergency, but the instances I\\'ve seen didn\\'t seem to be.) I usually bring my own cloth bag, and for some reason, this sometimes elicits eye rolling and deep sighs. \\n\\nDespite these flaws in paradise, Mani Market is still about six trillion times better than the nearby D\\'Agostinos, and nicely supplements our Whole Foods / Trader Joe\\'s excursions. I hope that idiosyncratic little family-owned grocery stores like Mani continue to buck the trend towards market consolidation (nytimes.com/2018/03/26/b…) for many, many years to come.

Mine was absolutely tiny and I kid you not, there was no more than a teaspoon of the cream cheese on it. Only about half my bites had any cream cheese at all. A laughably small amount of cream cheese. It was hard to eat, and I was very annoyed. Horrible, horrible experience, and I had to go somehwere else to fill up.

I always get a plain bagel w/egg, ham, and mozzarella. But today the server understood my order as an egg bagel with cold cheese and cold ham. . .For starters why would that be an actual order? But secondly, why would the server not politely ask if I wanted anything else in my bagel, such as egg? \\n\\nAnyways that\\'s a completely understandable mistake. After making it back home and realizing, I made it back to the store to get my order remade. This is when the dine-in server on the side of the cashier started to blame me for the mistake. Truly the hostile response was unexpected. He went on to demand I buy another egg sandwich only for the egg. This is when the actual server asked him if they could just add the eggs to the bagels as is. If you know about the food industry, this notion is against regulations but also highly discouraged during COVID. Food that has been prepped for to-go and has been served to a client should never make its way back to the kitchen counter since it poses a risk of contamination to the rest of the food being served. \\n\\nThe server is not necessarily at fault since she seemed new and was docile when dealing with this situation.

Both were delicious. I love how customizable you could make everything to suit your dietary needs. \\nI hate when matcha latte\\'s are not filtered properly and you end up having chunks of matcha in the latte, this one was perfectly filtered so I wasn\\'t getting a chunk of matcha in my mouth!\\nThe HOMEMADE granola is very sweet, however, you can customize it to your liking. You can add or subtract some of the fruit, add your milk preference, etc. What I like about the granola is that you can taste the maple syrup and the homemade goodness and the fruit is very fresh. \\nAnd the best part about this place is you can donate food/coffee to those in need !!!

Plowshares checks off all my mental boxes for a good coffee shop. \\nThe space is huge. It\\'s great for both individuals working or large groups gathering, which I feel is hard to find in New York. I meet with a fairly large group of women on Thursday mornings and the staff has been nothing but welcoming and efficient. When each one of us order something, the barista is still quick and I\\'ve never waited more than 3 minutes for my drink. I will often stay after and study by myself which is also enjoyable. \\nThere\\'s free wifi which is a God send to people looking for a place to sit down with a cup of joe and work for a bit. \\nThe electrical outlets for charging are easily to find and located throughout the place. \\nThe coffee is delicious.\\nThere\\'s a belgian waffle that is so tasty that I went home still thinking about it. I\\'ve been to Belgium and had a waffle there and I might even venture to say the one at Plowshares gives that one a run for its money. \\nI would recommend this spot to anyone.\\nMy only complaint is that it\\'s not closer to my apartment on the east side, but I will gladly keep going out of my way to come here.\",5,2019-09-26,40.7896239,-73.9598939\\nFilicori Zecchini,Lauren K.,\"Love this coffee shop!

It has a cool exterior and a solid layout. They don\\'t have table service but you order at the counter and they bring it to you. On first glance the menu looks solid until they tell you they are out of half the things on there. They have everything from acai bowls to flavored popcorn. It is eclectic to say the least.\\n\\nHeres the 2nd problem. It is right next to the train and every time the train passes on the platform above you literally can\\'t hear the person across from you talk. It is loud since the windows were open.\\n\\nWith all that being said the acai bowl was pretty good. The acai had a perfect texture and the fruit was fresh. No complaints only compliments. The shrimp tacos were messy and came in a cool presentation but did not taste fresh. The lady did mention a lot of items like the salads are pre-made so you can\\'t make many changes to the dish. \\n\\nI also tried the popcorn which is a good snack. It has cayenne on it or something like that. Kinda spicy but pretty good.\\n\\nThey had good wifi so at least I got some work done.

Having a primarily take out spot in this day and age is a plus. I stuck to the standards and ordered a pastrami sandwich and chicken noodle soup to share at home. I guessed correctly this was plenty of food to share. Actually, we still have some of the soup in the fridge with a large size being more than was needed. Both the pastrami sandwich and soup were excellent. The pastrami just about melts in the mouth. It came with mustard and homemade thousand island dressing on the side. I went with just the thousand island and it was so good. It came with a small side of coleslaw that I hogged for myself. It was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy.

The breakfast combo was pretty decent (2 eggs, bacon, home fries, and toast) and it was cheap. The food was pretty standard, and I really have no complaints about it. Fortunately, there is a small no frills dinning area in the cafe. I really did enjoy the fact that Superior Cafe had fresh cherries on the fruit buffet. I do not think that I have ever seen cherries on a buffet in NYC. Since this place is pretty close to Mt. Sinai, I can see this deli being very popular during work week lunch hours.

They had a bunch of pre-made foods which all looked good and fresh as well. The prices are really for what you get, I really enjoyed my BLT which came with a side Cole slaw and arugula salad thing, and it definitely filled me up! Its a cute clean spot near the park to stop for breakfast/brunch/a sweet treat.\\n\\nMy only real complaint is that the staff was a bit standoffish. There are no drinks listed on the menu and when I asked if they had coffee they answered yes as though I was stupid for asking. They also gave us the end piece of the chocolate chip loaf we ordered, which was considerably smaller than the other pieces in the display.

Oh, they also have a small appetizer menu where they offer hummus, falafel etc amongst other little items. Let me not forget to mention that this is one of the most expensive corner stores in the neighborhood! I guess that\\'s because they offer a \"\"healthier choice\"\". \\xa0So if you\\'re looking to buy something simple such as a bottle water, a soda or just a regular sandwich. I suggest you go to one of the \"\"regular\"\" corner stores in the neighborhood and save yourself some change. \\n\\nPros: It\\'s a convenience store! Duhh\\nThey have a healthier choice!

We had always enjoyed ourselves there and it was a great start to our trip! Unfortunately, due to COVID, i haven\\'t been to the court deli nor Yankee Stadium in almost two years. But now with Yankee games back on my schedule, that means the court deli is back on my schedule as well. The court deli is always packed and super busy, and with COVID, the place was packed, but very well controlled. Every table was socially distanced, after customers got up to leave, the employees got onto cleaning up the table right away so that new customers could be seated as soon as possible. Before I was seated, they took my temperature and had me record my information for exposure reasons, which I respect. The employees were hardworking, fast, and made sure their customers were satisfied! They were back and forth from the kitchen, on top of it all. The food came out quickly, and I\\'m sure everyone else\\'s did too. At the table, there was little containers of salt, pepper, sugar, and ketchup packets. I thought this was very cool. It had all the accessories you need to satisfy your meal! For my lunch, I ordered the pastrami sandwich with Swiss cheese, spicy brown mustard on the side, and French fries. The meal also comes with cole slaw and a pickle, but I had my eyes on the prize and did not even touch it. My father said it was good though. Anyways, this meal was absolutely outstanding! There was a mind-blowing meat overload! The juiciness of that fresh cut was immaculate and it was cooked to a perfection! The spicy brown mustard, which came in packets, and the the double layers of Swiss on each half were delicious and had amazing taste to the meat and bread. Now the rye bread was on another level. It was fresh, held the meat together, and absorbed some of that juiciness from the meat. Also, there was some pieces of fat which I was all over. This sandwich was a grand slam! And as for the French fries. Soft, thick, and a little crunch is all you need for a French fry. That was a home run!

Sounds like a heart attack and it definitely is; good flavor in the tenders and bacon. I would have preferred mozzarella over the nacho cheese to make it less sweet. Corn fritters are large handful of well fried corn bites served alongside a tangy aioli. Easy to eat and not overly breaded; does get greasy after a few, so best to share.

It\\'s the service that lacking. Ordered a bagel with butter, and they barely put any on.

Bagel and Barista. Barista would suggest there are people who prepare your coffee, but you pour and prepare your own hot coffee. \\nIced is given to you from workers, but have to sweeten yourself. It\\'s not a big deal to do that, but the name would suggest otherwise. Unless, of course, by adding the word Barista to the name, they have dubbed the customer as such. \\nAlso, ordering turkey with egg whites, they always give a different type of turkey. Last week it was Honey Turkey, another time it\\'s Sausalito. Don\\'t mind those types, but just want regular turkey. \\nAgain, the bagels are pretty good, but the people behind the counter don\\'t know much other than how to push buttons on the register. Anything beyond that seems to be bothersome to them. \\nI added a picture of my under-buttered, un-spread sesame bagel. That of which I had to go back in and ask for a spoon to spread it, myself.

A perfect croissant does not collapse after you bite into it- it rises back up and stands tall and proud, ready for your next bite. \\n\\nThat is the kind of croissant you will find at Petrossian.

The breading was crispy as it should be, but did get a bit too chewy/hard in the center, so perhaps it was a little stale. I liked the custard with the hint of orange - comparing to Cerasella\\'s, it was less orange-y which is a personal preference, but the breading was not as good/fresh as Cerasella\\'s. The price is cheaper, although Cerasella\\'s is bigger.\\n\\nBerry Napoleon: 4.5/5 $5.75 I\\'m glad I don\\'t have to go all the way to Martha\\'s for these anymore. Martha\\'s is amazing, but can be inconsistent - I got a slice once and the layers were soggy, probably was sitting out for a few days.

I will also say that their everything bagels lack enough seasoning! I always add Trader Joe\\'s everything but the bagel. Would love if they added carroway seeds to their everything bagels.

This ice tea was the equivalent of a grande at starbucks, should have been closer to venti to warrant paying as much for an ice tea as I paid for the sandwich. \\xa0The ice tea and sandwich were good, but not nearly worth what I paid for it. \\xa0I understand times are tough now but I\\'ve ordered from several delis around the area and have never felt ripped off like this. Every deli I\\'ve ordered from has provided bigger sandwiches for the same price and have never had the nerve to charge over $5 for a drink. \\xa0 \\n\\nAdditionally, the delivery man wasn\\'t wearing a mask. I also read a review that someone saw none of the employees were wearing masks. \\xa0This is pretty alarming and shows complete ignorance of what\\'s going on with COVID. Every deliveryman I\\'ve encountered through seamless has always worn a mask but not this one.\",1,2020-05-26,40.7127281,-74.0060152\\nDouble Dutch Espresso,Nhi D.,\"Although I want to support small, local coffee shops instead of Starbucks, I think Double Dutch is too overpriced.

We had always enjoyed ourselves there and it was a great start to our trip! Unfortunately, due to COVID, i haven\\'t been to the court deli nor Yankee Stadium in almost two years. But now with Yankee games back on my schedule, that means the court deli is back on my schedule as well. The court deli is always packed and super busy, and with COVID, the place was packed, but very well controlled. Every table was socially distanced, after customers got up to leave, the employees got onto cleaning up the table right away so that new customers could be seated as soon as possible. Before I was seated, they took my temperature and had me record my information for exposure reasons, which I respect. The employees were hardworking, fast, and made sure their customers were satisfied! They were back and forth from the kitchen, on top of it all. The food came out quickly, and I\\'m sure everyone else\\'s did too. At the table, there was little containers of salt, pepper, sugar, and ketchup packets. I thought this was very cool. It had all the accessories you need to satisfy your meal! For my lunch, I ordered the pastrami sandwich with Swiss cheese, spicy brown mustard on the side, and French fries. The meal also comes with cole slaw and a pickle, but I had my eyes on the prize and did not even touch it. My father said it was good though. Anyways, this meal was absolutely outstanding! There was a mind-blowing meat overload! The juiciness of that fresh cut was immaculate and it was cooked to a perfection! The spicy brown mustard, which came in packets, and the the double layers of Swiss on each half were delicious and had amazing taste to the meat and bread. Now the rye bread was on another level. It was fresh, held the meat together, and absorbed some of that juiciness from the meat. Also, there was some pieces of fat which I was all over. This sandwich was a grand slam! And as for the French fries. Soft, thick, and a little crunch is all you need for a French fry. That was a home run! Today\\'s experience at the court deli was one to remember, and I can\\'t wait to be back!\",5,2021-05-01,39.9545613,-74.3784815\\nBlack Seed Bagels,Judy Y.,\"I\\'ve been waiting for Black Seed to open for months in the concourse of Rockefeller Plaza and the wait has been well worth it. \\n\\nThey make really good bagel sandwiches, this time I ordered the Boca (avocado, tomato, egg, cheese) with an everything bagel, and there\\'s not much to say except that it was just really good.

I would take care of this bagel as long as we both shall live. That is how much I loved this bagel.\\n\\nThe location is terrific, right off the 116th street subway station on the B/C subway lines in Harlem. I thought the customer service was really good too, as the cashier was super friendly and patient with me as I asked my dozens of questions as to what was good. I got myself a plain bagel with cream cheese and lox (a good go to).\\n\\nAs the cashier explained, they use 2.5 ounces of lox (nice amount) with cream cheese of my choice on a bagel of my choice. It amounted to $12, very reasonable for the experience.\\n\\nThis bagel is heavenly. It is a little sweet; with the perfect crunch and chew. It is perfect in size, not too big, but not too small. The lox is placed on perfectly as is the cream cheese. It simply looks iconic and tastes the same way. Fresh, neat, fishy, savory, and yet it still carries that New York angst when you carry out that brown paper bag and see your sandwich wrapped in wax paper, the wax paper ready to be torn apart.\\n\\nI was completely happy with this bagel that I was dreaming about it for hours after I finished it.

Zabar\\'s is a veritable wonderland for those seeking a great deli, fresh smoked fish, cheeses, bagels, pastries, and almost anything else you might desire. There\\'s even an entire upstairs area just for housewares, kitchen items, and even knives. There\\'s a feeling inside this store as if it\\'s alive in some way and you\\'re part of a very specific NYC microcosm. My father, a self-proclaimed corn muffin connoisseur, said that the one I brought him from Zabar\\'s is among the best he\\'s ever had.

Very burnt, very small, and the bun has no taste, there is no snap to this frank. Heavily overpriced. Star rating: 1/5\\n\\nPotato Pancake: Since tonight is the first night of Chanukah, I had to get this today. It is so big, and so dense. I took five bites and knew right away this was not going to be finished. This is best shared. It has a nice flavor, and you get applesauce along with it. Please eat this with caution as it oozes with oil and grease. Star rating: 3/5\\n\\nPastrami sandwich: Smaller than Katz\\'s, there is no sample included before you get your sandwich. It is very wet, but unlike Katz\\'s, it is not juice, just wet meat. It is very much an okay cut of meat. I was expecting more out of this sandwich and got little in return. Sure, they give out spicy mustard and pickles with it; the spicy mustard is good, and the pickles make the sandwich more digestible, but it does not feel like a New York sandwich. It feels rushed, processed, and care-free. Star rating: 2.5/5\\n\\nJelly donut: It is called Sufganiyah in Hebrew; I had to get this too because of Chanukah! This is a must have during the holiday. Unlike the rest of what I ate, this is delicious. The donut is not over cooked, the jam comes through beautifully. The sugar is not overbearing and it has the perfect sweetness. They told me they only make this treat once a year, during Chanukah only, and that is a good thing. Bring out the heavy artillery when the time comes! Star rating: 5/5\\n\\n--\\n\\nI feel like I am comparing David to Goliath here, but sadly, David loses this match. It tries hard, with the friendly service, and the fact that they accept credit cards, but the experience is not enough recommend my business again, or recommend it to others. The prices are not much different than Katz\\'s (this place is a little cheaper), but there is a reason more people flock to Katz\\'s than here. \\n\\nSometimes, the Goliaths do it better.

It\\'s the closest place you can grab a meal to JTS and UTS. It\\'s not kosher, but they don\\'t have any meat, just fish and dairy, so most JTS folks are comfortable eating here.

It\\'s not amazing but it\\'s drinkable and the location is convenient. \\nThe soups are hearty but way too salty, especially the lentil and the split pea. There\\'s a spinach pie (spanakopita) for $4.50 that\\'s the cheapest meal around, and delicious to book. \\nThere\\'s one gender neutral restroom in the back, and room for around 15 people to sit at tables.

There wasn\\'t anything outstanding about this place, but it wasn\\'t half bad, either. There was a good amount of seating, the coffee prices were good for the amount of coffee you\\'d get, and the food seems to be okay. I only had the spinach pie, but it was decent. Everything about this place is okay. I think it\\'s a safe place to go to have a quick and cheap lunch!\",3,2017-12-24,37.5482697,-121.988571\\nBroadway Bagel,Lola G.,\"A cozy, small place with wonderful sandwiches. One of the best bagels in the UWS. The staff is very very friendly and welcoming, always helpful. Been here a couple of times and the size of their bagels is incredible, i cant eat it on one go))) Bagels are always fresh and flavorful. And the price is soo pleasant. I recommend this place for freakfast or lunch. I would give it 6 stars if i could.

I live just around the corner and go here all the time. They have really good sandwiches with the standard Boar\\'s Head. The breakfast sandwiches are also really good. \\n\\nThe guys who work here are awesome as well. They really try and get to know their customers.

Come on guys!!!\",5,2015-01-24,40.7896239,-73.9598939\\nFuel Juice Bar,Rachel G.,This place is very small and new to 125th st. \\xa0I am glad that there are healthier options popping up on this street. \\xa0I thought the smoothie was expensive and tasted just ok.,3,2019-10-04,40.7127281,-74.0060152\\nSable’s Smoked Fish,D. R.,\"In the midst of the pandemic, I\\'ve taken to ordering smoked salmon delivery for myself as an occasional treat. \\xa0The good news is that the smoked salmon from Sable\\'s, delivered by Goldbelly, is incredibly good. \\xa0The Scottish, Norwegian and Gaspé are delicious beyond words, sliced thinly and with care, well packed in several layers of protection plus ice packs for the two-day delivery journey. \\xa0In the whole world, there is nothing tastier. \\xa0\\n\\nThe bad news is that to meet the delivery minimum I continually have to order an item besides the pound of salmon I can store and eat at a time without risking freshness. \\xa0Here the news isn\\'t as good. \\xa0I have ordered their scallion cream cheese a few times, and the quality has varied enormously. \\xa0The latest version was watery and possibly on the verge of not being fresh. \\xa0Earlier versions tasted ok, but ranged from smooth to lumpy with curds. \\xa0Don\\'t know what to make of that. \\xa0\\n\\nThen I have tried their \"\"Plain Herring Filets\"\", which is advertised as in the photo attached to this review with the slogan \"\"Once you try Sable\\'s tender pickled herring fillets you\\'ll never settle for the canned stuff again!\"\" \\xa0As you can see, their picture shows shiny, large herring fillets rolled up. \\xa0What is actually delivered are tiny strips of herring in murky sweet pickle juice: \\xa0reasonably tasty, but not obviously different from what you can buy in jars at Whole Foods (don\\'t know about cans) for much less money: $5.99 at Whole Foods vs. Sable\\'s $27.95, for approximately the same quantity. \\xa0\\n\\nI have also tried ordering H&H bagels from them, which came roughly packaged in a large jumble, and not as fresh as similar orders from other NYC shops.\\n\\nSo what to do? \\xa0I am still hunting for an add-on to my smoked salmon purchases that is worth the money and that I want to eat. \\xa0Because indeed the salmon is really really good. \\xa0If only they lowered their $75 delivery \\xa0minimum, or offered a greater varety of addtional items at a reasonable cost, the problem could be solved.\",4,2021-01-15,42.3602534,-71.0582912\\nThe Bagel Shop,Morgan C.,\"This place has the best bagels on the UES. The sandwich menu is amazing and everything is so yummy! If you want the most delicious muffin every, order the chocolate cheesecake muffin. I can\\'t express how good it is!

I really wanted to try a black and white cookie and from what I read, this place is the best of the best.

They used to be around the corner and have been in business since I can remember with mostly the same staff. \\nIm so glad they found a bigger place where you can sit and they now have a broader menu. But they haven\\'t lost touch in their welcoming energy, delicious flavorful pizza and my ultimate favorite, zeppoles! They have the zeppoles at 4 for $1. They are fluffy and full of delicious powdered sugar. They make two to three batches a day so you know they are always fresh. My mom lives near them and has tried pretty much everything from the menu. From their tacos, rice and beans with baked chicken, and all day breakfast, she has yet to be disappointed. \\nThe staff is great, the place is always clean and stocked and I appreciate all the work they do to keep prices reasonable and my tastebuds coming back!

The customer mistook the staff\\'s intention and assumed the staff was being condescending. I think the staff was short-handed trying to manage a morning rush of 8+ customers and spoke a little quickly but had kind intention in trying to explain the different beverage options. \\n\\nTo be honest, I had just ordered and I was a little confused with so many options so I understand why the staff may over-explain things to help customers better choose what they need. Additionally, the menu shifts and something what I want to order isn\\'t available so more talking is required at times.\\n\\nThe regulars were shocked at the interaction and how quickly the customer unraveled. I think this is a great neighborhood cafe and have greatly enjoyed my food and drinks. The staff did well handling a difficult morning interaction with a store filled with waiting customers. 5 stars for professionalism and class. The food is a 4 but the staff really makes it a friendly and memorable interaction each time I visit.\",5,2019-12-06,40.7127281,-74.0060152\\nMarche Madison,J S.,\"Mediocre service and extortionately expensive. This should be marked $$$!\\n\\nPrices aren\\'t marked on the prepared food so you need to ask about everything (and everything is well above $10/lb, closer to 30/lb and some even 60/lb). They wanted $2.25 for a single nectarine. Ended up getting a bagel with cream cheese which had a layer of cheese so thin you could barely taste it.
